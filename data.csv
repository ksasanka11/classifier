What is computer science?,-xFJM3QQ3TE,computer science,"Frederick: COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE ART OF TEACHING A COMPUTER WHAT TO DO. I'LL START WITH SOMETHING SIMILAR. LIKE, A SCREWDRIVER IS A TOOL THAT IS MADE TO KIND OF TURN SCREWS, AND ON ITS OWN, IT'S USELESS. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT IN YOUR HAND AND KIND OF TURN IT TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN. Peters: A COMPUTER ACTUALLY LEARNS A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS AND ACTUALLY TRANSFORM THAT INTO A WAY OF SHOWING A MOVIE OR PLAYING AN AUDIO FILE OR DELIVERING FACEBOOK. AND THAT WHOLE STUDY OF HOW THE COMPUTER THINKS IS COMPUTER SCIENCE. Campos: IT'S CODE, AND SO CODE IS A BUNCH OF SYMBOLS AND LETTERS, BUT IT'S REALLY MORE LIKE A LANGUAGE. Bigio: I GOT HERE FROM PUERTO RICO, AND I DIDN'T KNOW ENGLISH, SO I HAD TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO PERFECT MY ENGLISH. PROGRAMMERS DO THE SAME THING. THEY LEARN NEW LANGUAGES TO DO NEW THINGS. THEY ARE INPUTTING THIS LANGUAGE AND THIS INSTRUCTION INTO THE COMPUTER SO THE COMPUTER CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT THEM TO DO. ♪♪ Frederick: GROWING UP, I WAS ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAD ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AROUND ME. AND I REMEMBER BEING BORED ONE DAY AND I PICKED UP THIS BOOK THAT WAS NEAR THE COMPUTER THAT SAID ""BASIC PROGRAMMING,"" AND IT HAD THIS REALLY SIMPLE ""GETTING STARTED, HELLO, WORLD"" PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD WRITE IN BASIC, AND I REMEMBER WRITING IT AND RECOGNIZING THAT, ""WAIT, HOLD ON. I JUST PUT THIS THING IN AND TOLD THIS COMPUTER HOW TO DO THAT, AND IT CAME BACK OUT."" AND I HAD MY BROTHER COME IN AND USE IT, AND HE'S LIKE, ""OH, MAN, YOU MADE THE COMPUTER SAY HELLO?"" I WAS LIKE, ""YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, I DID. ISN'T THAT COOL?"" ♪♪ Ghadiyali: IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES, YOU SPEAK LANGUAGE AND YOU USE THAT TO COMMUNICATE AND INSTRUCT WHEN YOU'RE AROUND PEOPLE. SIMILARLY, A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING. IT'S JUST A LANGUAGE THAT YOU'D USE TO TALK TO THE COMPUTER. Frederick: AND THINK ABOUT THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. LET'S SAY IT'S AN ALARM CLOCK. THERE ARE INSTRUCTIONS THAT SOMEBODY PUT INTO THAT ALARM CLOCK TO TEACH IT HOW TO TELL TIME, HOW TO RESPOND TO YOU HITTING THE SNOOZE BUTTON. YOU'RE WALKING OUT OF THE HOUSE AND YOU JUMP IN YOUR CAR AND YOU START IT. THERE ARE LOTS OF COMPUTERS IN THERE FIGURING OUT HOW TO TURN THE ENGINE THE VERY FIRST TIME, HOW MUCH GAS TO PUT IN. THE SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE PUT INTO ALL THESE LITTLE DEVICES YOU'VE USED THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY JUST MADE YOUR DAY THAT MUCH EASIER TO GET THROUGH. Bigio: YOU WANT DIRECTIONS OR YOU'RE DIALING A PHONE NUMBER, YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH A COMPUTER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AT HAND. THAT'S COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PROGRAMMING RIGHT THERE, EVERY DAY IN YOUR HAND. Ghadiyali: PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO HAVE IMPACT IN THE WORLD. THERE IS NO OTHER CAREER, NO OTHER FIELD WHERE YOU CAN TOUCH SO MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES WITH JUST A SIMPLE SOFTWARE OR A SIMPLE APP. AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY ALSO IMPORTANT FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT COMPUTERS ARE EVERYWHERE, PROGRAMMING IS EVERYWHERE, AND WE WANT AN EQUAL REPRESENTATION WHEN WE ARE BUILDING PROGRAMS. Frederick: WE NEED PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES TO FIND DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. Bigio: CREATING PRODUCTS FOR THE PEOPLE, YOU NEED TO BE THE PEOPLE. AND IF WE HOPE TO HAVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT REALLY SERVE OUR NEEDS, WE NEED TO BE INVOLVED -- PROGRAMMING, LEARNING COMPUTER SCIENCE, AND BEING PART OF THE CREATION PROCESS OF THIS NEW WAVE OF INNOVATION."
What is Computer Science Principles?,jQm0z894CG0,computer science,"It's pretty amazing when you start building something that you want it can help change a lot of people's lives as well. And having even a little bit of grounding in computer science can help you think about the world differently. Whether that's algorithms or whether thats just creativity. Computer Science Principles covers lots of topics. Not just programming and coding... we cover bits and binary, we cover how the Internet works, how security works, how data is collected and used and shared. And all of these things help you get a better understanding of how the world works. Now I understand why my phone is so slow. I thought computer science was just, like for y'know, really really smart nerds, geeks, but... it's not. It's for everybody and I think it's something that everybody should learn. In the new economy computer science isn't an optional skill, it's a basic skill. I just think it's important, moving forward in the future that everybody learn it - especially kids. I didn't know what I was getting myself in to but like once I had my friends around I knew that if they could do it I can do it. So it's really like brought my confidence up in other classes as well. If you use SnapChat and Instagram and you want to know how that works take Computer Science Principles. Make an app yourself. See how you can share these things with your friends. To be able to code gives you the freedom to build anything. And that is just so empowering! We're doing a lot of teamwork, like group work. Like doing work on paper not just always on the computer. And then when I say ""go"", we're gonna exchange IP addresses without talking. And I want everybody's IP address. Some of the kids that maybe don't fit into a normal classroom they have an opportunity to kind of try different things and different techniques and different mindsets. It feels more like a puzzle. And you get to take your own route and find the solution. I feel like this class is one of the only classes that challenges me. But I feel like ""Y'know what - I got this!"" Like, this is good. Computer science isn't just about math or computers. If you're interested in designing things, creating things, solving problems... then this class is for you. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
Steve Jobs on Computer Science,IY7EsTnUSxY,computer science,"I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer. Should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think. And so I view computer science as a liberal art. It should be something that everybody learns, you know takes takes a year in their life, one the courses they take is you know, learning how to program."
Computer Science Basics: Algorithms,kM9ASKAni_s,computer science,"You may have heard the term Algorithm recently, whether it was online or maybe in some conversation about technology. It's a word that gets thrown around a lot. But what exactly does it mean? Well, simply put an algorithm is a set of steps used to complete a specific task. They're the building blocks for programming and they allow things like computers, smartphones, and websites to function and make decisions. But in addition to being used by technology, a lot of things we do on a daily basis are also similar to algorithms Let's say you want to make some spaghetti. In order to do this successfully,  there's a certain set of steps you need to follow in a particular order. First you need to boil a pot of water. Once it's boiling you then add the spaghetti and cook it for a set amount of time, stirring occasionally. Once it's finished you drain the water and then it's ready to be served with a sauce of your choice. That entire process is actually an algorithm. Because you followed those steps in that order, you reached your desired outcome, a delicious pasta dish. But, if you were to make a mistake, say over or under cooking your noodles, it probably wouldn't be as good. Programs work in a similar way. Their code is made up of algorithms telling them what to do. Let's say that we want to use a navigation app to get directions. When we punch in a destination, the app uses an algorithm to look at the various available routes. Next, it uses a different algorithm to check the current traffic. And then a third one takes that information and calculates the best available route. All of these algorithms are built right into the apps code. If there were any kind of error in that code, the app wouldn't be able to follow these algorithms correctly. Meaning, you wouldn't receive your directions. Both of these examples show how both humans and computers can use algorithms to perform everyday tasks. The difference is that computers can use algorithms and calculate things better, faster, and more efficiently than we can. Technology is only going to continue to evolve and get even better at what it does. As long as coding and programming continue to be used, algorithms will be at the heart of these technologies guiding what they do and how they do it.

President Obama asks America to learn computer science,6XvmhE1J9PY,computer science,"Hi everybody. This week I'm proud to join the students, teachers, businesses and non-profit organizations taking big new steps to support computer science in America's schools. Learning these skills isn't just important for your future, it's important for our country's future. If we want America to stay on the cutting edge, we need young Americans, like you, to master the tools and technology that will change the way we do just about everything. That's why I'm asking you to get involved. Don't just buy a new video game, make one. Don't just download the latest app, help design it. Don't just play on your phone, program it. No one's born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work, and some math and science, just about anyone can become one. This week is your chance to give it a shot. And don't let anyone tell you ""you can't."" Whether you're a young man or a young woman, whether you live in a city or a rural area, computers are going to be a big part of your future. And if you're willing to work and study hard, that future is yours to shape. Thanks everybody!"
Why I chose my major: Computer Science &amp; Engineering,UKA3HMz2Qf0,computer science,"I chose computer science because, at first, I just really liked coding and I thought, 'Wow, this is a lot of fun.' But then I also saw how many different applications there are. You know you go in thinking, 'I'm just going to sit at a desk and code. But then you realize there's so many different applications of this field that can really help people, whether that's artificial intelligence or biomedical devices. There's just so many diverse ways to be creative. So what I love about computer science is that it really starts out at the general level and so you get an idea of all the different components that go into computer science. And then once you get into the upper division, you get to choose a track and find what really speaks to you and makes you excited to do work. And, so for me, that's been the security track—where I'm really excited about all the classes. I get to learn about how the computer systems work and how they're built to make them more secure. And I'm really excited to keep learning more about that as I go on. I know a lot of my friends are doing research, and I've done two internships now. It was two years at the same company and then this summer, I'll be doing another one. And it's really great because here there's so many software companies just everywhere—that you can really get your footing even as a sophomore and get that opportunity to learn outside of the classroom. At first I was a little intimidated by the professors. I was like, 'Oh you're doing all this stuff, you don't really have time to talk to students.' But then you go to their office hours and you realize, 'Oh you really do care about the material you're teaching and the students you're teaching it to.' And I think a lot of them really show that by taking the time to have conversations about the topics that they're teaching— not just what's on the homework. But also how is this going to play out in the real world and how will I face this in my career. And I really appreciate the time they take to do that."
Careers with Computer Science: Aerospace Engineer at NASA,2uXTNK9W-gQ,computer science,foreign Davis and I'm an aerospace engineer at NASA what's NASA and liftoff NASA is a space agency that is looking to help the world better understand what's going on around us and other planets [Music] what do you do at NASA I use computers every day I program spacecrafts to look at specific points on a planet to get back science data [Music] what do the spacecrafts do various missions that we have they have different objectives whether it's increasing the knowledge on the weather to things like increasing knowledge about asteroids when did you learn about computer science I knew about computers growing up we had you know computer class but I wasn't that into computers and maybe it was because I thought that wasn't like the cool thing to do but it wasn't until later that I started to understand what possibilities come with computers and then I started saying this is actually kind of fun after I took a class in programming now it's something that I do almost on a daily basis something that I thought I couldn't do I'm doing every day and it's a lot of fun what is the coolest thing about your job the single coolest thing to me about working at Nasa is the fact that I can look into the sky at night and think about all the spacecrafts that I've worked on that are currently orbiting the Earth or orbiting an asteroid is really rewarding and so that's really cool to me [Music]
Computer Science Basics: Should I Learn to Code?,reU05DbfWOM,computer science,"In recent years, there's been a lot of hype around coding: that it's an invaluable skill everyone should learn, or that it's a field where there's a lot of money to be made. And, while there are a lot of great reasons to learn to code, it might not be the best career choice for everyone. In order to determine if coding is a good fit for you, you'll want to consider a number of different aspects. One thing to think about is the job market: there are a lot of jobs and freelance opportunities out there for programmers, and many of them pay well, but there are also even more programmers seeking jobs. Studies showed that there are 50% more people seeking employment than there are actual coding positions. This means that simply knowing how to code isn't a surefire way to land a job: employers are looking for the highest quality programmers out there. Like any skill, coding takes dedication and patience to develop: the more time you put into it, the better you'll become. Learning your first coding language might prove to be a long and difficult process, but the good news is that once you've learned one, others become easier to grasp. As technology continues to evolve some new jobs are going to be created, but some of today's jobs will also become obsolete. Some argue that it might be a better investment to study growing fields, like AI and machine learning; but, on the other hand, learning to code is a great way to gain an understanding of software from the bottom up, and it can serve as a jumping off point if you want to move into those fields in the future. So, should you learn to code? There are a lot of opinions out there, but ultimately it's up to you. If it seems like something you really enjoy and you're willing to put in the effort, go for it, but if it's something you're on the fence about, you might want to keep looking. There are a lot of other options out there, and you're bound to find something that's a better fit for you."
The Beauty of Computer Science | Computer Science Motivational Video,mCJWiR3Vdi8,computer science,"This is such a strange thing. Your software Linux is in millions of computers  it probably powers much of the Internet.  And I think that there are like a billion  and a half active android devices out there   your software is in every single one of them. It's kind of amazing. You you must have some amazing  software headquarters driving all this. That's what I thought and I was  shocked when I saw a picture of it. I mean this is this is the Linux World Headquarters. Well I do code for fun. But I want to code for something meaningful. So, every single project I've ever  done has been something I needed and uh So, really both both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have  to work with too many people.  Absolutely! Yes now yeah That's that's amazing. I think everybody in this country  should learn how to program a computer.   Should learn a computer language because it teaches you how to think. It's the idea that matters. It didn't matter where you come  from or what your background is One revolutionary idea One brilliant invention can unleash other entrepreneurs to revolutionize industries in  ways you could never predict. People working anywhere in the world. Born anywhere in the world. Can create a product and make it available to anyone in the world. The most used messaging app in Southeast Asia   was built by a young man born  in Ukraine who moved to the U.S. And the three most popular viral  games in the U.S in recent years came from entrepreneurs in Finland Ireland and Vietnam You're the ones building the next Google The next Spotify The next Tesla The next... Well we don't even know. But what I know is that someone  in this room will build it. Computer science is by far  the closest thing to magic. And it's certain that the world wouldn't be where it is right now without the existence  of this magnificent branch of science. And this branch of science is growing so fast that it's difficult for even good  programmers to keep up with it. Every day a new technology is releasing. Every day new opportunities are rising. "

Computer Science at Cambridge,94NgNNs1O3Q,computer science,[Music] one of the things that is really unique and special about computer science degree in Cambridge is that you're gonna be taught by cutting at world leaders in their own fields who are really excited about their work the course of Cambridge involves pretty much anything that you can think of to do with computers and technology from really foundationally theoretical material on automation of mathematics at one extreme - intense funding projects at the other I've always been fascinated by the way that computers can solve problems both for myself and for other people and that's that's really really interested in me so it seemed like a natural thing to study when I went to university I've always enjoyed doing logic puzzles small challenges and also I wanted to learn everything that I could about computers which I think computer science embodies perfectly but also I want it to be in a really good challenging environment which Cambridge offers and have all these brilliant minds around me computer science at Cambridge seemed just the right course [Music] our course is structured so that we teach our students the theoretical background that underpins the principles of computer science but also with their hands-on experience of putting that theoretical knowledge into practice my favorites perience on the course so far has been the group project in my second year in which I worked with a group of people to produce a piece of software for a company I got to present the project to all the other students and the people from other companies and it was really exciting [Music] the employability prospects for our graduates are really first-rate we're also a very intrapreneurial place so lots of our graduates go on to found their own companies and startups one thing that we find out when we start studying computer science is that this is a subject that opens up so many different doors we can we can work in many different fields doing many different things what I would like to do is go and work for a software company and maybe with that learn some skills in my own so I can I can start my own in the future and solve problems my own way by applying for masters and then going on to do research either here at your lab or an industrial research I feel I will be able to bring a contribution to the field of computer science [Music] fundamentally computer science ends up being about solving really hard problems in the best possible way so if there's one key thing that you couldn't come away from the Cambridge degree in computer science with it's being a really really good problem solver we are genuinely interested in people who are self motivated and passionate about technology if you're curious then come to us and we will teach you the theoretical and the practical ways of how you can build systems that are going to make our world a better place Oh
Computer Science Matters,_IiPLtP-jm8,computer science,"So what grade are you in? Second. Tenth grade. First grade. I was in eighth grade when I learned to program. I got my first computer when I was in sixth grade. What gets me excited is being able to fix people's problems. You can express yourself. You can build things from an idea. Computer science is the basis for a lot of the things that college students and professionals will do for the next 20 or 30 years. I like programming because I like helping people. I get the opportunity to build something that makes people's lives easier. I think it's the closest thing we have to a super power. Getting started is the most important part. I'm a beginner myself, and I want you to learn with me. "
How MIT computer scientists got to MIT,huYmEFkd5Y8,computer science,"[MUSIC PLAYING] How did you get to MIT? I sort of had a long path to getting here. But I was a math undergrad, and then I actually was an economics PhD for a couple of years before deciding that robotics was my true calling. And then through a fortunate series of events, I ended up working on the dark robotics challenge and then ended up in Russ's lab. I came to MIT after my PhD at Boston University. I did my PhD in robotics. And before I did robotics, I actually studied pigeons and how they fly and their dynamics of flights. And so pigeons is the way I got into robotics, by looking at the dynamics of them and then wondering what could happen if you could also control those systems. I finished my undergrad and my masters back in 2011. And then I was working in industry for two years at Johns Hopkins applied physics lab, which was fun, but it was more development. And I really wanted to do research. I really wanted to go back for my PhD. So I worked on a few research projects and I applied for my PhD a few places. Got accepted to a few. Got rejected from a lot. And I wound up joining everybody here at MIT for my PhD. So I did my undergrad here, and I really liked the community. And especially I did a UROP, the undergraduate research with Daniella. So I enjoyed that and I was happy to stay on as a grad student. I won a scholarship for my research being one of the grand challenges in engineering and a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge. And this year, I'm a Charles M. Vest scholar at MIT. I had mentioned to an undergrad professor that I was thinking about maybe applying to PhD programs. And she said, you know, you should do it. You should definitely do it. You know, who cares if you get it or not? You should definitely try. And I think that little push that someone believing in me was what I needed to get over my fear and apply to MIT and that is how I got in. I came here as an undergrad and I came to the admittance day weekend. And it was a lot different than all of the other colleges I had been to and everyone I met was really interesting. So I sort of just decided to come. And then once I was here, it became really hard to leave. So I'm still here. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
MIT Computer Scientists talk about their first computer science textbook,7PbuWwWXftg,computer science,"[MUSIC PLAYING] What was your first computer science textbook? I feel like it was called, like, Java by Construction, was my first textbook. It was like an introduction to programming in Java, which I took in a freshman coding class at Princeton. My mom gave me a textbook when I was about eight years old, an introduction to Python. And she started reading it to me when I was in class, and that was a huge moment for me. I got a textbook on MATLAB programming, I think. And I don't know if I ever cracked the spine of it once. CLRS textbook, the algorithms textbook that they use in the algorithms class here at MIT-- it's definitely like a mammoth of a textbook, but I feel like it's sort of a rite of passage. I wasn't a huge fan of textbooks. I mostly read the course notes that were posted in a lot of classes. But there's an introduction to algorithms textbook I used. I think it's by one of the Kleinbergs, and Eva Tardos as well. And that was a great textbook. I love that textbook. And it's really fun, because each problem is sort of structured as like a little puzzle that you have to solve. So that was my first textbook that I enjoyed. You know, I don't think I've ever used a computer science textbook. When I really think through all of my computer science classes, maybe they assigned a textbook, but I didn't get it. Most of the time the problem sets were available online. The lectures were all available online. And most of what you learn is from Googling all the different questions you might have, and other people telling you from-- maybe, I guess, textbook-wise, Wikipedia. Wikipedia is my favorite computer science textbook. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
Create With Computer Science,lud4bU3YY9U,computer science,well I think creativity plays a role in almost everything that we do from cooking to making music which is what I do but in computer science you have to have a creative mind [Music] computer science it is Art and everybody has a different style and I think that that's a beautiful thing about computer science is that it's flexible as you iterate through code and you start seeing what experiences you're lighting up it is just like a piece of art when you read someone else's code it's almost like reading poetry you try to follow how their mind went about solving a problem no art exists without technology a paintbrush is a piece of technology a typewriter is a type of technology so as we keep coming up with new types of Technology artists are always going to come in and find some new ways to use it in ways that are unexpected there is no creativity without technology and Technology does not exist without creativity [Music] [Applause]

The Future of Computer Science Careers,l0YuUIiEVhs,computer science,"The following portion of daytime tri-cities is sponsored by Amazon. computer science continues to be one of the fastest growing and best earning areas of our economy. A new Gallup poll of kids is revealing what they say could make them 10 times more likely to go into the computer science field as Alex Davis explains. It's about making a people connection. Computers and Robotics are a mainstay in our everyday lives yet a Gallup poll in partnership with Amazon found that while kids interest in computer Sciences, widespread participation is not nationally. We see that 70% of students report that there's at least one course within their school system today where they can take computer science and learn more about the topic. Unfortunately, that number drops dramatically for who live in rural areas throughout the U.S. and soon to come from lower-income households are far less likely than their peers report. There is, of course, currently available within their school more about computer science. The Amazon future engineer program.

Favorite programming languages of MIT Computer Scientists,39b_GSDPwCY,computer science,"[MUSIC PLAYING] What's your favorite programming language, and why? I definitely like Python. I actually learned to code on C and C++. And it's a lot harder when there are more brackets and more complicated things. And I feel like Python abstracts away a lot of that while still giving you a lot of functionality, and allows you to do a lot of really cool machine learning things. My favorite programming language is Python because of ease of use and speed of development. And I especially love using [INAUDIBLE].. I like Python because originally, I learned how to program in C. And Python is just a lot more high level, and it's a lot easier to use. I hate them all equally. No, that's not true. I like most programming languages. Lately I've been programming in Python. It's a fairly convenient language. My favorite programming language is probably C#. I like it because it fixed everything that Java did wrong. But mostly it's become a standard in the gaming industry. And I really love video games. I love being able to program video games. And it's a really nice, easy-to-use language. Honestly, I guess I would probably say Python, which is maybe a boring answer, because I guess a lot of people would say that. But for me, it's just really easy to prototype and build things quickly, which is important in my research. I love Python. I think Python is like writing English at times. It's almost so easy to understand for programmers, [? even ?] when you want to do the low-level things, which is incredibly powerful. I prefer Python because it's easy and you can program very easily tasks, and you can see the results quite quickly. At the risk of not being a programmer, I do a lot of programming in MATLAB because that's what I know. And it's very good for controls. But for a real language, I like Python. I can say my least favorite, also if people want that, is C and C++, because you make a ton of bugs and they're impossible to solve. Waste your whole day. [MUSIC PLAYING]"

Crash Course Computer Science Preview,tpIctyqH29Q,computer science,"Hello world! I’m Carrie Anne Philbin and welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So, computers really have allowed us to do some pretty amazing things - think global telecommunications, international commerce, global transportation, breakthroughs in medicine, distributed education, online shopping, online dating, just the Internet in general. Computers are allowing us to explore our own world and other worlds, and of course some seemingly mundane things like permitting us to spy on our pets from work or communicate with our friends in a nearly indecipherable stream of emoji! But don’t call computers magical. They are not, I repeat ARE NOT, magical. So before we get into what we are going to talk about in this course, it might be useful to tell you what we aren’t going to talk about. We aren’t going to teach you how to program. Programming is a really crucial aspect of computer software, and we will get to the rules that guide the logic of hardware and software design. But we aren’t going to teach you how to program an Arduino Uno to water your plant or how to change the CSS on your grandma’s sewing blog so visitors’ cursors turn into kittens. This also isn’t a computing course. Or at least how computing is thought of in the U.S. Computing here is a goal - it’s what computers do. And we’ll talk about some of that for sure, but OUR goal for this course is much broader. But computing means other things in other countries. It’s all pretty confusing. But what we are going to look are the history of computers… even before we had electricity. We’re going retrace the design decisions that have given us our president-day components. We’re going to talk about how Operating Systems work… or don’t work… how the YouTubes get to you over the Internet, how our smartphones and other smart devices are... well getting smarter, and of course mysterious futuristic stuff like quantum computing and frustrating present-day stuff like hacking! It’s a lot to cover, but I suppose before we get started I should introduce myself. I’m Carrie Anne Philbin! Hello! I'm an award winning secondary Computing teacher, author of 'Adventures in Raspberry Pi' and the creator of a YouTube video series for teenagers called the Geek Gurl Diaries, which includes stuff like interviews with women working in technology, computer science based tutorials, and hands on digital maker style projects. In my day job, I help people learn about technology and how to make things with computers as Director of Education for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which is a charity based in Cambridge in the UK. Needless to say, I am passionate about this stuff, but not because computers are these amazing devices that are always making our lives easier (sometimes that’s debatable) but because computers inarguably have become pivotal in our society. From our cars and thermostats to pacemakers and cellphones, computers are everywhere, and it’s my hope that by the end of this course you’ll have a better understanding and appreciation for how far we’ve come and how far they may take us. I’ll see you next week."
Change the Face of Computer Science,uhcA6K8rWp0,computer science,"I was first introduced to computer science when I was in high school. My first experience with technology was when I was very young, about six years old. It was part of our curriculum at the school I went to. I made my way into computer science class and I loved it so much, that I ended up double majoring in both theatre and computer science. Growing up as a kid in the inner city, I never learned a thing about coding, and it's so important. All my girlfriends have taken a computer science class and I'm the odd person out right now. Having access to technology, and for me in particular, being able to code, was a multiplier. I wanted to do computer graphics, I wanted to be a graphic designer. And people found out, they laughed at me, you know, all these things. And I'm like ""Man, I don't care, I think it's cool!"" ""I'm learning a lot, and some of my friends have jobs."" Opportunities are endless for someone who's getting into computer science, that's a job that's in high demand right now. We have all different types of people who work in computer science. We need more participation by women, by more people of color, to provide a different perspective. To provide a different lens on which problems matter and how we should approach these problems. It's not just programming, it's not just building things, it's an entire different way of seeing the world. There's a way, that even when you're coding, you can help make this world a better place. It's a really fun place to be right now. I hope you guys want to be entrepreneurs, you wanna have your own business, you wanna create opportunities for your family. You wanna create your own app, or your own platform, or whatever. I'm here to say today, that you guys can do that. Computer science is for everyone, literally everyone. Some people think you need to be a genius to get in, and that's so far from the truth. I know it can be intimidating, and a lot of things are intimidating - but what isn't? Don't give up, don't be discouraged, don't let anybody tell you that you can't do something. If you're a high school student that's thought about taking computer science, just go after it! We need diverse teams of people, in order to make products that reflect what our world looks like. It's not just a means to an end, it's something that gives us hope, to solve every problem the world potentially has. We're on a mission to help change the face of computer science. We're gonna learn to code together, bring the family, gather around. Anybody can do it - you should try. Push yourself. Anybody can learn. Just give it a try,"
Online Computer Science Bachelor&#39;s - Colorado State University,ec5vegLMkTM,computer science,technology is our future if you look at how jobs are being created in the united states it turns out that having a couple of years of computer science is becoming an essential skill computing is really about how to go after problems how to solve problems how do you look at the world how do you look at these giant problems that we have break them into smaller parts figure out how to solve those parts and then reassemble it back together it's a way of thinking and often people take that term and they look more in the mathematical sense but it's not really that sense it's more in the term of using logic and philosophy and saying how are we going to solve these problems that we have using that technology in computer science at csu we are extremely proud of our online program it's historically rated one of the top 15 or 20 in the united states when you finish the degree you have an extraordinarily valuable job skill our students are the highest paid students graduating from the university so we have a fair bit of support and we try our best to make sure that the online experience while different contains the same content and the same quality of learning as our on campus program we emphasize heavily about the community aspect behind programming and the idea of someone sitting there and programming in a cubicle by themselves is false it only actually happens about 25 of the time but then about 50 of the time you're actually working in what is known as paired programming working with partners and getting to understand each other and helping each other with code and we emphasize even for our online students that being part of the community is also helping create a future for yourself they're entrepreneurs they're innovators they're people that are not only looking for a job but looking at a way to make change and they want to change the world by means of technology if you share our passion for computer science and want to take the next step in your education don't hesitate to contact us
Computer Science Careers at Montgomery College,wDn_UvwPhnI,computer science,"♪ Music ♪ Montgomery College is giving me the opportunity to achieve my goal. I'm doing things I never thought I could see myself doing when I was a senior in high school. The Montgomery College Computer Science program offers computer science and technologies associate degrees and also and also two certificates: computer programming certificate and Java developer certificate. Most of the classes I teach are eighteen to twenty, twenty two students, something like that, so you get a lot more attention. I think the fact that we have smaller classes at Montgomery College is helpful, primarily for the fact that professors, they can pay more attention to you, because there's less people. Amazing, amazing, amazing professors! I so miss them. Students come out of this program very well prepared. Montgomery College prepared me for my classes at College Park. Even on my first day I felt like I was prepared for what was about to come. The job market is very good for computer science and technology students. They are in demand. And there are less graduates than jobs available. I'm really happy that I came to Montgomery College. Montgomery College really helped me to get where I am today. ♪ Music ♪"

Is a Computer Science Degree Worth It?,mh4jtC5pTQ4,computer science,"Without a degree you're putting yourself at a disadvantage. Imagine you have the same resume as another person, but they had a degree and you did not. Who do you think is going to get picked?"
Learning computer science without a computer,x-H04b_3ShA,computer science,"KIA ORA. Kia Ora, we are students from Christchurch New Zealand Did you know you could do computer science without a computer? But first, I need some of these. Today, learning computer science skills is as important for our children as learning reading or writing. And yet so many children worldwide don’t have access to computer science education devices, or trained educators. It’s true. That’s why we’ve been working with Google, developing ways to teach computer science without devices. Using everyday activities like puzzles, art and games, teachers can bring to life the big ideas behind computer science. You can use playstick fruit to show how computers avoid bottlenecks. Musical sounds to illustrate parallel sorting algorithms And for binary numbers, a birthday cake is always fun. I need one more volunteer. Teaching without computers means any student, anywhere, can learn computer science. And you don’t have to be a tech expert, before you can teach it. You’re going to choose one tile and flip it over. Are you ready? I have found that students really enjoy computer science learning, because it's just fun and interactive. The world faces big challenges, from pandemics to the climate emergency. That’s why we are supporting the next generation of computer scientists. Whoever and wherever they are.  Wait, we need to move all of the fruit down here so we can get this down to Jessica. Haere rā"
Summer of Research: Where Music Meets Computer Science,SWzK8VWVt3s,computer science,"[Graham Palmer] I looked at the 14th harmonic maybe the difference is really small but its, its completely random. [Jake Altabef] My name is Jake Altabef. I go to RPI. I am a rising junior and I study computer systems engineering. This summer I'm doing research analyzing music, specifically jazz. So far, we looked at signal-to-noise ratio over mediums from vinyl to cassette to CD. We've also done frequency analysis. I've never had a formal music education, no music theory or anything like that. What I have in college is essentially coding and algorithms. Seeing this connection between audio engineering and music with computer science is really good because it gives me somewhere to put an end goal in my career. As I'm wrapping up college, I know that I need experience either doing research moving forward into a PhD or moving into industry. Going back to audio engineering, I would like to do a master's in that. That'd be really cool something that I haven't done before, something that I should have pursued. During the semesters, once it gets to mid and late semester, I will be doing like 40 hours of coding for one class and just having the freedom to not do anything during the summer other than research is incredible."
Computer Science Undergraduate Research at the University of Iowa,UzjJ1zmDMfs,computer science,"Computing lets you explore, understand  and amplify human abilities in essentially every domain. Instead of using a wet lab, I use computers. You have to find something that you're interested in enough to work on every day, even though you won't be seeing results every day How do you attack and solve complex problems knowing how to do that is an incredibly valuable lifelong skill. The calculations I'm running are very complex and they take a lot of time. I could run them on my desktop computer it would just take exponentially more time to complete and I could run it on  thousands of computers and have resulted in four days instead of a month or two. you can treat a patient based on their personal genetic makeup and I think that's something that's also really exciting because you know that you're contributing something that can help people and make a difference"

Computer Science Field Guide: Computer Graphics,5kuoRjgfCls,computer science,"Computer Graphics is used to create all sorts of images. But at the end of the day they're just pixels that have been given a certain colour value. Computer Scientists who work in Computer Graphics work out how to take an object, do some calculations and translate that to a computer screen. For example: we need to think about an object's rotation; its position in 3D space; and its size. [quack] This also involves specifying colours mathematically, and working out what objects should appear in front of others. And how to add shadows, and reflections. Even working out which pixels to use to draw a circle, or a line isn't that simple. In this chapter, we're going to look at some of the challenges and some of the calculations needed to get the right pixels in the right places on the screen. Computer Graphics"
Computer Science on the Court,Vh2lg3RL7vE,computer science,"I'm Jeremy Thompson. I'm a member of the Men's Cross Country team and I am a computer science student at the UPEI School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences. So the research that I was involved in looks at athletic movements and analyzing people's movements. So the way that we analyze people's movements is by gathering EMG signals with sensors that wrap around your forearm and provide activation signals of how much the muscle is firing. We can look at the readings from that and compare that to a model and essentially provide feedback. I've always been involved in sports, whether it be basketball or running, and this really allowed me to tie in my computer science knowledge to something that I was genuinely interested in. The thing I like most about computer science is the amount of opportunities that it provides you. You really have opportunities to work in whatever field you're interested in. Computer Science nowadays is finding its way into everything from athletics to analytics to anything else you can imagine I love the amount of opportunities that it gives you."
Become A Computer Science Teacher,9VvuRiFQv10,computer science,"There's so many computer science jobs out there that are not being filled. So the more computer science teachers we have in our school systems the more students we will be able to reach. And getting past that initial fear of what computer sciences is, is what's gonna change the whole field of computer science. The curriculum is very accessible to first-time teachers. I think it's also accessible to experienced teachers. If you didn't have any background knowledge of computers, technology, computer science whatever the case may be, you can successfully teach this course. So it's great. Having lots of teachers in the classroom will give us the ability to adapt to a future that frankly none of us can predict. The workplace has changed. Education has to change. And this is all part of helping to prepare students for the world that they're going to work in. If you have an interest you need to go for it! And you need to do that really not just for yourself but certainly to benefit your students. They need stuff that is relevant and this... I think this is it. Yeah."
Why study Computer Science?,-gnW2p9FF9c,computer science,I decided to study Computer Science because I had the background I particularly always liked robots My interest started probably as most young boys' interests start in computer science is when they get their first computer for me i've always had an interest in computers from a young age and it's one of those things that I wasn't too sure what I wanted to go into and computer science obviously offers a wide diverse range of opportunities you can look into I was about 16 making A Level choices I decided I really wanted to make video games which for instance now I don't want to do but it did spark my interest in the subject once I actually came to university I realised there's a lot more to computer science than just games development I did lots of different types of work experience to work out what I really wanted to do I was always good at mathematics and computer science at school I was into gaming as a kid I think the thing with computer science is that it entrenches so many different fields that we all go in our life It really opened my eyes to see what computing could be used for in the real world and make people's jobs a lot more efficient I can go into so many things with computer science it was trying to choose between maths and computing and got really into programming The sixth form I went to had an A Level in computing and from there you know my favourite subject I started reading science fiction books and movies and the AI part of it all very interested me my inspiration actually came from one of my classmates he used microcontrollers to make a little simple toy car move by the means of a joystick or a telephone and I was like wow if you can do this how many others things can you do I wouldn't say I'm a stereotypical computer scientist I don't think that stereotypical computer scientist is actually a thing
Undergraduate Computer Science at Birmingham,Gy4CiUvz2R4,computer science,the biggest thing that stood out to me when i first visited was the feel and the vibe of the campus and the school computer science itself it's a really nice place to be and it's really great to explore what opportunities there are around campus even just walking through the building you can really easily talk to staff and other students and get to know them really well the main reason i chose birmingham was the open day i came onto campus and just fell in love with the place i spoke to so many students that day as well and they all just seemed so happy to be here i could tell their relationship with the staff was just amazing i was like this is the place i want to be i think that students should choose birmingham because besides the beautiful campus that we have we offer our students state-of-the-art facilities and laboratories such as dedicated robotics and cyber security labs but also to a large general purpose computer labs where our teaching happens there's lots of different societies um at the university the gilda students itself has over 300 societies and we have quite a few in the school of computer science i'm the president of computer science society and we put on lots of different events for students and staff from socials workshops to events helping you in your career but the greatest thing in my opinion we have managed to create here in our school an environment that fosters communication cooperation engagement not only between students but also between students and staff my advice to some new students would be to get involved with as many opportunities as you can whether that's joining societies or getting a summer placement they really help to enrich your experience while you're at university just come ready to make friends and with an open mind
Study computer science at Bath,-pGWKFtpyYI,computer science,"If you ask anyone, what can you do with computer science they'll always just say you can do anything. Bath is just a beautiful place to study it's a really nice atmosphere. The range of modules even from the first year, doing things I'd never heard of or never thought I would be doing. We have access to the computer science department 24 hours a day. They have organised tutorials and then you have a tutor assigned to your group who help sort of lead the discussion. We had companies come in and do workshops with us. They help you all through all the stages, It feels like all the lecturers are really approachable. They push you, they guide you, in the right direction instead of giving you the straight answer. So you know how to approach different problems instead of knowing the solution to the exact problem. They do a lot of work for us so they're happy to help wherever they can. They really want to make you the best computer scientist that you can be. There's a multiple group coursework where you have to actually design and develop some software. What it looks like, or what you actually code is pretty much up to you. Me and my partner made a piano, where you press the button on one and it communicated to the other one. Some people made the cupboard and it would send a tweet. There's so much kind of creativity. It's really good with hackathons helping charities, who might not have the kind of money to make some bespoke software. The University hosted one a couple months ago called Launchpad. You're giving a specification and at the end of the 24 hours you'd have coded it and developed it it's just really nice to meet new people and also come up with new ideas. The course really gives you a good ground in the commercial environment. So it's prominent in industry right now what we learn. Our university's great reputation is having students who are really good for industrial placement. Most students that go on placements get offered a graduate scheme for when they come out which is really good for employability. I'm still supported by the University but I'm getting some real life experience before I even get the graduate market. It's all about using the tools that we have to make life better for everyone else and we've come so far. Every day the theoretical computer science becomes more practical. It's just really exciting to be involved in I just want to make a change I want to make a difference. I want to see my own contribution to computer science somewhere out there, so I'll see it someday."
Vinesh Kannan: Computer Science,48sKPaFeyqg,computer science,"Being at IIT, it's really great to have access to all of Chicago's offerings, both in technology and beyond. We've had access to 1871, the startup incubator, we've had access to Chi Hack Night, a top civic technology meetup in the city of Chicago, and countless other organizations that are designed to help people of all ages learn more about technology and how the city works. Chicago is also a great city to study computer science and data science because the city government makes unprecedent amounts of data publicly available for anyone to work on, and those have exposed us to a lot of rich and nuanced challenges that go beyond having better algorithms or better computer systems and go into deep questions about governance society and all kinds of other topics. After graduation I accepted an offer to work as a software engineer at Google. I'll be moving to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to join the team there and work on projects related to software engineering and machine learning. I'm really excited because I view that as a next step in learning more about computer science and what it means to be an engineer in today's technology climate. Before I go to Google I'll be working this summer as part of the Civic Digital Fellowship. It's a program that recruits college students to work in a federal agency for the summer, and I'll be part of a team at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in D.C. working on building models to automate paperwork about occupational codes. I'm really excited for that opportunity because I'll be the only computer scientist working on a team with economists, statisticians, and psychologists. And those are the kind of things that I'd like to do going forward. I really want to be involved in teams that are multidisciplinary and that are working on really difficult, really complex problems that impact other humans, and I hope that in the future I may be able to join or start another young company that still has time to define its culture, its approach to solving problems, and how it will be a responsible part of the technology community."
Computer Science Field Guide: Introduction,v5yeq5u2RMI,computer science,"Welcome to our guide to Computer Science. One of the main reasons that we've created this guide is that although computers are a big part of our lives and in the world all around us, A lot of people don't really understand what Computer Science is. I was going to take Computer Science but, I basically already know how to use Word and Excel. And it is one of those things that you don't really notice until it's missing. For example then you end up with things like really. Slow. Programs. Or, incredibly, frustrating, interfaces. Or, systems, that can't cope with large amounts of data. And these days, a business can become a thousand times bigger overnight. That's exactly when you need it to be able to cope with a lot of data. We'll look at topics like: Computer Security, to make sure that any personal information you're holding can't be accessed by hackers; or Artificial Intelligence, for planning and decision making; Computer Graphics, for entertainment and also visualising large amounts of data; and Computer Vision, where a computer can sense objects and even people in the world around it. We'll look at computer programs that take so long to run that they won't finish in a lifetime, even on the fastest computer. We'll think about what it means for a computer to be intelligent. And we'll look at how compression works so that we can take thousands of songs and fit them on a device that's small enough to fit in your pocket. Computer Science is many things to many people, and after working through this guide, you'll have a better idea of what Computer Science is, and especially how we can use it to design software that will help people in their everyday lives."
Unplugged - What is Computer Science?,HsXaVV6fFDY,computer science,"What do you want to be when you grow up Olivia? Umm, an astronaut! Do you happen to know what a computer programmer is? Yeahh, umm, no. Umm, what what? I'm not really sure how to explain it. Computer programming is pretty simple. It's a set of instructions, like a recipe. You have to follow them step by step to get the end result you want. Computer science is a way to impact the world. It can be music videos, it can be games, detect whether or not someone is related to someone else. Find you know, people's friends. You can do all sorts of other crazy things that actually save lives. You do have to have a drive I think. It is to me like a paintbrush. I think great programming is not all that dissimilar from great art. When I finally learned a little bit of programming, that blank wall resolved into a bunch of doors and you open them and of course then you find behind them is another hallway filled with a bunch of doors. Programming is fun and easy. You can do anything your mind wants to do. Finally you start to open enough doors the light comes in. To me a finished program is like a structure filled with light. All the corners are illuminated. The number of people that you can touch and interact with is something the world has never seen before. Our first lesson in this series is all about what computer science is, what a computer scientist does and how you can be more responsible in your use of technology. It's a very important lesson but it is a little text-heavy. At the end, you get to make your very own customized encoding using your initials. It's a fun activity and it's very empowering because binary is one of those things that feels very technical but once you understand it, it's like you speak a secret language."
Theoretical Computer Scientist Subhash Khot | 2016 MacArthur Fellow,n7v9psW3Qwo,computer science,"My research area is the study of power and limitations of computing. In short, it is the study of what computers can do and more computers cannot do. I'm Subhas Khot. I'm a theoretical computer scientist We would like our computers to do a lot of things for us and in theoretical terms these are called designing algorithms to solve computation problems. For the last several decades, computer scientists have identified a very large class of problems. These are known as NP complete problems, which they would really like to solve fast . But now they have more or less accepted that these problems cannot be solved fast. The Unique Games Conjecture, it states that certain very specific computational problem about coloring nodes of a network to satisfy certain compatibility conditions and the conjecture states that this problem is very hard to solve and, in fact, very hard to even find. There is only approximate solutions and what the main consequence or the implication of the unique games conjecture is that, if you believe that this one specific problem is hard to solve, it implies that lots and lots of other problems, which computer scientists are very interested in, there also hard to solve. The Unique Games Conjecture it's it's not yet proven, however the research surrounding the conjecture, all these efforts, they have actually led to many many developments in computer science and mathematics. On the other hand, it's also useful that certain competition problems simply cannot be solved fast, and one such example being factoring integers. For example, if I tell you number 35 and you're supposed to find its factors, if I times  7, this cannot be solved fast for when the numbers grow really large, and it turns out that the security of almost on online systems ,let's say banking, it depends on our belief that nobody knows how to factor integers fast. So the Unique Games Conjecture it led to quite surprising discovery in entirely unexpected area of research. We know what elections are and often the result of an election is simply decided by majority vote, Uf there are two candidates, then whichever candidate gets more votes wins. The Unique Games Conjecture, it led to the reason that this votingscheme is stable under noise, meaning even if the words where  miscountered or maybe there was little bit of noise in recording the votes. It won't really change the the winner of the election by much. For several years, I have been trying to make progress on proving the Unique Games Conjecture ,and in the last four or five years me along with my coauthors, we do have a quite promising approaches that I'm excited about. I personally have started believing that we do have actually an approach to prove it and I'm I'm excited in following these approaches and I see where these go."
First Things First: Why I Study Computer Science | UConn,s_C9yE1588A,computer science,the first programming language  I had exposure to was Python and this was really cool experience for me because  it was the first time I got to you know type some words on a page and it would actually be something that would function you'd see like you see words popping up you could make it interactive you you just have a whole bunch of different logical like ifs and aliases and then you can make an entire game out of it so  this experience in high school was what really led me to look into computer science at UConn and once I got in a tour got to meet some of the professors  I really knew it would be a great fit since I've started here  it's been amazing I've gotten more experience in Python I've got experience in C and Java  and I just love all of it it's all different ways of using logic to be creative and make something that works
Shaun’s story - MSc Computer Science,_CCCPHkwb24,computer science,"I just want to keep my options open. When I was doing my A-levels it was the same thing. Always just looking for the broadest avenue that I could take. My undergrad, I did a psychology degree which I actually did here, at the University of Bath. It was a good all-round degree that allowed me to explore lots different things. So I went looking for jobs  and landed myself in a summer job. I liked the work I was doing but at the same time a lot of the software that we were using,  they're quite outdated, very little support for them. I found that quite frustrating. I'd always been sort of interested in computer science and it definitely inspired me to learn and maybe find myself in a role one day where I could be building systems that could help people. The course is quite collaborative and fosters this sort of environment where you're always sharing ideas and talking to people and everybody on this course wants to do well and wants everyone else to do well. The lecturers were always made themselves available. I chose to do the module called  Intelligent Control and Cognitive Systems and we were building robots out of Lego and setting them off so to roam around the room and I've enjoyed all the coding that we've done on the course,  I find it a good challenge. A Computer Science degree is just so sought after, so valued. And think that's what I've found pretty much everywhere that I've gone. Now people are like knocking on my door. The world thrives on data these days, you know. It's the most valuable asset that you can have. The study of computer science holds the answers to the questions that you might not even be facing yet. You're designing something that's making someone's life in some way, easier. You do something that you  have a sense of ownership over. Just how can you top that as a feeling?"
"Dr. Yihsiang Liow: Associate Professor of Computer Science, Columbia College",Q3O7Xc3gVHU,computer science,"Computer Science is really everywhere. We are surrounded by computers. Now in terms of studying computer science at Columbia College, we have a small learning environment. Students interact among themselves and they have a good interaction with instructors too. So, they get to learn effectively and efficiently. Well one of my favorites would be Intro to Programming, Introduction to Programming, because that is when you get to see the new students. It is right at the beginning of the programming career or computer science career. The instructor will have a great impact and that is when perhaps interaction with students is maximal, when they are more dependent on the instructor. I think computer science is different from many other areas of study, because you have to solve problems. There is logical thinking and problem solving involved. At the same time whereas in other areas of study where you study the theory, in computer science you actually implement the theory. For instance, you can understand the logic behind a computer game and then you can write your own game. Students find that really exciting. Because of our small environment, students get to learn things effectively and efficiently. So the small environment allows us to really prepare students for their lives for professional life."
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic | Computer Science | Khan Academy,8CluknrLeys,computer science,"Imagine we are living in prehistoric times. Now, consider the following. How did we keep track of time without a clock? All clocks are based on some repetitive pattern which divides the flow of time into equal segments. To find these repetitive patterns, we look towards the heavens. The sun rising and falling each day is the most obvious. However, to keep track of longer periods of time, we looked for longer cycles. For this we looked to the moon, which seemed to gradually grow and shrink over many days. When we count the number of days between full moons, we arrive at the number 29. This is the origin of a month. However, if we try to divide 29 into equal pieces, we run into a problem. It is impossible. The only way to divide 29 into equal pieces is to break it back down into single units. 29 is a prime number. Think of it as unbreakable. If a number can be broken down into equal pieces greater than one, we call it a composite number. Now, if we are curious, we may wonder how many prime numbers are there, and how big do they get? Let's start by dividing all numbers into two categories. We list the primes on the left, and the composites on the right. At first they seem to dance back and forth. There is no obvious pattern here. So let's use a modern technique to see the big picture. The trick is to use a Ulam spiral. First we list all possible numbers in order in a growing spiral. Then we color all the prime numbers blue. Finally, we zoom out to see millions of numbers. This is the pattern of primes, which goes on and on forever. Incredibly, the entire structure of this pattern is still unsolved today. We are on to something. So let's fast forward to around 300 BC in ancient Greece. A philosopher known as Euclid of Alexandria understood that all numbers could be split into these two distinct categories. He began by realizing that any number can be divided down over and over until you reach a group of smallest equal numbers. And by definition, these smallest numbers are always prime numbers. So he knew that all numbers are somehow built out of smaller primes. To be clear, imagine the universe of all numbers, and ignore the primes. Now, pick any composite number and break it down, and you are always left with prime numbers. So Euclid knew that every number could be expressed using a group of smaller primes. Think of these as building blocks. No matter what number you choose, it can always be built with an addition of smaller primes. This is the root of his discovery, known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, as follows. Take any number, say 30, and find all the prime numbers it divides into equally. This we know as factorization. This will give us the prime factors. In this case, 2, 3, and 5 are the prime factors of 30. Euclid realized that you could then multiply these prime factors a specific number of times to build the original number. In this case, you simply multiply each factor once to build 30. 2 times 3 times 5 is the prime factorization of 30. Think of it as a special key, or combination. There is no other way to build 30 using some other groups of prime numbers multiplied together. So every possible number has one, and only one prime factorization. A good analogy is to imagine each number as a different lock. The unique key for each lock would be its prime factorization. No two locks share a key. No two numbers share a prime factorization."
What is cryptography? | Journey into cryptography | Computer Science | Khan Academy,Kf9KjCKmDcU,computer science,"Imagine two people who share an important secret have to split up. This requires them to communicate private information from a distance. However, an eavesdropper named Eve also wants this information, and has the ability to intercept their messages. So, Alice decides to communicate using letters written in some kind of secret code. The following analogy is helpful. First, Alice locks her message in a box, using a lock that only she and Bob know the combination to. This is known as 'encryption.' Then, the locked message is sent to Bob. When Bob receives the box, he opens it using the code they shared in advance. This is called 'decryption.' Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks and use 'ciphers' instead. Think of [ciphers] as virtual locks. Ciphers allow Alice and Bob to scramble and descramble their messages so that they would appear meaningless if Eve intercepted them. Cryptography has been around for thousands of years. It has decided wars, and is at the heart of the worldwide communication network today. The fascinating story of cryptography requires us to understand two very old ideas related to number theory and probability theory."

Master of Science in Computer Science: A Distinctive Program Creates Exceptional Graduates,D6uDVv4de-M,computer science,"""One of the unique things about our computer science program is that we have the areas of cybersecurity and digital forensics and networks that really help build up your computer science skills in today's society. We don't focus on one programming language. Many universities when you go to their curriculum you see that 'you know what we're just gonna teach them C, right? We have a different philosophy here at the University of New Haven. We think and we know in fact that by the time you graduate you're going to have to know multiple programming languages therefore by the time you graduate you must have at least experienced three programming languages, including Python which has been rated recently as one of the most used programming languages. We have for example a course in Introduction to Digital Forensics. We have a course in mobile device forensics. We have another course that's in reverse engineering. These are courses that will prepare you 100% to enter the workforce."""
Josh Caratelli | Computer Science | RMIT University,SHsHiq2q0zk,computer science,"So I really love computer science because it's a great mix of working with fantastic people and combining technical and creative skills. I've always been a huge gamer, I love playing games and the social interactions you have with games and it wasn't I met game developers in person that I realised how passionate and creative and just awesome they were; that I went, hang on I'd love to do this as a job. My name's Josh Cartelli, I'm studying at RMIT University doing second year computer science and my day job is a junior  gameplay programmer at big ant studios. RMIT was a very obvious choice for me for a couple of reasons. The first being just the culture, the people here are super nice, super passionate if you have an issue or if you want to extend yourself RMIT's there for you. And secondly, in my field of computer science and game development, people overseas have heard of RMIT, and that just goes a long way. For me some of the biggest skills I've gained aren't the most obvious ones. Sure there's lots of technical math knowledge I learn in my classes, but the biggest one is working together with a team, how can you work together to achieve a common goal. One of my major achievements so far was launching iPhone game with my friend Liam McLaughlin. It's called Smog Game and teaches kids about saving the environment. We even created own company and talked to Apple reps and PwC and Epic and it was really cool just to go from this very small idea to actually have a finished product. I think the future of computer science and game development is heavily leaning towards tech such as AR and VR, but the thing I think people overlook the most is the democratisation of game development and app development. Anyone can get started now, tools are becoming cheaper or free, and just as a bedroom coder make your dream idea into reality, really."

What is Biology?,6v8djXa-IPQ,biology,"What is Biology? You may have learned to classify a rose or a human as living, rock and water as non-living. But why is this so? If you say that ""living"" is something that moves, but then flowing water can be called ""living"". Right? That's not entirely true. Life has a set of properties that an organism has to follow to be called ""living"". And a wonderful discipline of science studies life in great detail. It is called Biology. The word ""Bio"" means living, and ""logy"" means study. So Biology means the study of living things. Simply put: Anything which interacts with its environment, use energy and reproduce are known as living things. For example, we, humans, eat food to get energy, feel and respond to our environment, and reproduce to make more of ourselves. Many other living things like insects, birds, and animals have the same properties like us. So, they are all living organisms. Now the question arises how many types of living things are there? And how are they different from us? Biology is a field which answers these questions and many more questions related to living things. What is Biology? There are 7 characteristics that a living thing follows and therefore we study these in the vast field of biology. These are: One: Order If you examine a rose from near, you will notice it is very ordered. The petals are folded around each other with the center-bearing seeds. This illustrates the highly ordered structure that typifies life. Living cells are the basis of this complex organization. Two: Reproduction Organisms reproduce their own kind. A mother giant panda will always give birth to a panda, not a horse. We learned that from Kungfu Panda, too. Three: Growth and Development Inherited information in the form of DNA controls the pattern of growth and development of all organisms. You most probably look like your parents or close relative, thanks to the genes. Four: Energy Processing We, humans, eat food to get energy. The food we eat has also eaten some food to utilize its chemical energy stored in order to power its own activities and chemical reactions. Five: Responds to the environment All organisms respond to environmental stimuli. This is why you laugh when you're tickled. Six: Regulation Many types of mechanisms regulate an organism's internal environment. Keeping it within limits that sustain life. This is also called homeostasis. A lemur sunbathes to help raise the animal's body temperature on cold mornings. Seven: Evolutionary Adaptation Lions use camouflage to blend in with the savanna so they can easily hunt down an animal. Such adaptations evolve over many generations. Some new concepts like genes and DNA are introduced in this video. These will be explained in our upcoming videos. Stay tuned!"
Biology: Cell Transport,ufCiGz75DAk,biology,"Cell transport is the process of how things move in or out of the cell through the cell membrane There are two broad categories of cell Transport The first Category is passive transport, for a cell passive transport means It's an automatic process that doesn't require any input of energy for example Diffusion is a passive process in which particles move either into or out of the cell from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration The cell doesn't use any energy when this happens The second Category of cell Transport is active Transport This is when particles move from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration when particles move against the concentration gradient Energy is required often to allow protein pumps to assist in Particle Movement why would the cell need to move particles from a low to high concentration and expend energy to do it An Important example is seen in your heart muscle cells In order for your heart to beat there are certain molecules that have to move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration for those cardiac muscle cells to work So the main things to remember are passive transport happens automatically with no energy required while active transport needs energy for it to occur  "

What is Homeostasis? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,quQr6X1Q58I,biology,"So what is homeostasis? Homeostasis is a term first defined by Claude Bernard in 1865. It means maintaining a constant internal environment. Wow, great, that really explains it doesn't it. Let me try and make it a bit clearer then. Imagine the cockpit of a plane, it is packed full of dials, And it is the pilot's job to make sure they all stay in the right place. If any of them change she will correct the plane to keep them in the right place and the plane in the air. This is a bit like how our brain works. Sensors all around the body are measuring various things and sending the information back to the brain. The brain then does its best to keep all these things stable and constant to keep the body working properly. This is homeostasis maintaining a constant internal environment. So what kind of things needs to be kept constant in the body? Well, it's very important to keep our temperature the same at around 37 degrees Celsius. You can find out more about this in the video on temperature regulation. You also need to keep the levels of sugar in the blood constant along with levels of ions and water. Your blood pressure needs to be carefully monitored along with the amounts of waste in the blood such as carbon dioxide and urea. Okay, so let's say one of these factors goes too high or low. What is the brain going to do to get it back to the normal levels? The answer to that is negative feedback. Negative feedback is the process where the brain uses either hormone or nervous system to send a signal to the part of the body that can rectify the problem. For example, after you eat a meal your blood sugar level increases You can see it on this graph. This is detected and the pancreas will release a hormone called insulin that causes the sugar to be stored in the liver. Therefore, as you can see on the graph, the blood sugar level returns to normal. Negative feedback is the loop from which the body detects the stimulus, reacts by responding accordingly, and brings the body back to the normal levels. So why is homeostasis so important? Our metabolism, which is all the chemical reactions in our bodies that keep us alive, is controlled by enzymes. These enzymes only work in very specific conditions. If these conditions change, they could stop working and we could die. Luckily all this happens without you having to think about it. If you had to do it yourself you would spend all day and night just trying to keep all these things constant. And would have no time to do anything fun like watch videos of cats on the internet."
WELL THIS IS AWKWARD: Matt Walsh has to educate biology student on biology,mB573AmATKw,biology,"Student: Hi. I thought you had some really good points, but I just wanted to ask you about hybrids and stuff because I'm here studying biology, and so we've learned a lot about genetic mutations, and disorders, and such, and there actually are hermaphrodite humans beings, where they have both ovaries and testicles. And that... I have it right here. It's actually a medical condition called ""ovotesticular disorder."" And there are also other genetic disorders where people are born with XXY, just X, or just Y, and such. And while it may seem rare, there are hundreds of thousands of people born with this each year. And so, going off of your fairytale hybrid people, they do exist, and I'm just wondering how that would play into your view of there being a spectrum of gender because... Walsh: These are people who can get pregnant and also impregnate someone else? Student: Yes. Hermaphrodites have both ovaries and testicles. Walsh: No. No. No. [Audience chattering] Walsh: If such a person existed, I would not include that part in my next speech, but... [Audience laughter] Walsh: ...such a person does not exist. Now, intersex and gender deformities, as you talked about, do exist, and I expected someone to bring that up in the Q and A. I think it's a fine point to bring up. Two things I would say to that. Number one, that actually has nothing to do with transgenderism because if when we're talking about transgender, we're talking specifically about intersex people, then we would just say ""intersex."" But with transgender, most of the time, we're talking about men who don't have any deformities, they are just straight-up men, clearly, and they are identifying as women. So even if I agree that what you're talking about is some sort of exception, that actually would have nothing to do with the transgender topic. But I don't think it is an exception because, as I said, I think a true resident of the middle circle of the Venn diagram would be someone who has the reproductive capabilities of both genders, and no one like that exists. I mean, not to be crude, but there isn't anyone who can get themselves pregnant, right? That doesn't exist in the human kingdom, anyway. So I think what you're talking about there are people who have deformities, and so in their case, it would be more difficult than usual to determine what their actual biological sex is because the usual indicators aren't there or aren't as obvious, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a biological sex. It's just not as clear."
Biologist Career Video,JcAUqJoUgBI,biology,"From the smallest microorganism to the giant blue whale, every living thing is of interest to biologists, who study the basic principles of plant and animal life. Biologists use the scientific method, testing their ideas or hypotheses through experimentation, to investigate questions about the origin of life, its development, and the relationships between living things, as well as a creature’s anatomy and how it functions in its environment. Whether they’re working in a lab, out in the field, or at a university, biologists collect and analyze biological data, although the specifics of their research are as varied as the creatures in nature. For example, some biologists may work almost exclusively with computer models, while others may spend months collecting and studying specimens at sea. Many specialize in working with plants, animals, or the environment. Biologists need strong communication skills. Their work is often as much about interacting with people and institutions as it is focusing on DNA or anatomy. A career in biology generally requires a bachelor’s degree in the field. Many biologists attend graduate school to earn more advanced research positions or professorships."

Cells - Introduction | Biology | Don&#39;t Memorise,_u3GEXZPDa8,biology,"We all love reading story books. Every story is framed with sentences, and sentences are framed using words. And what are words made up of? They are made up of letters! If you notice, then everything around us is made up of one or the other smaller entity. These small entities are called Basic units! Did you know, that even our body is made up basic units? Yes it is! Although it appears to be one single body, it is actually made up of millions of basic units coming together! what these units are called? They are known as CELLS! Cells come in different numbers to form our body, rather, any living organism’s body. Can you guess the minimum number of cells required to form an organism’s body? Do you know the answer? There are organisms which are made up of only a single cell! They are called the unicellular organisms! Bacteria are one of the best examples of this category. what are organisms like us called then? We belong to the category of multi-cellular organisms. Those having several cells to make up the body are called multi-cellular organisms Now the next important question is… if there are so many cells in our body, then are all of them exactly the same? Of course NOT! There are many number of cells in our body, and so are their types! Look at these cells for example! These look so different! But astonishingly, all three are a part of our body! This one is an ovum, this is a neuron and the last one is a Red Blood Cell. Their structures, shapes, sizes are totally different from each other, and so are their functions! This is how various types of cells come together in different numbers to form our body. We have this knowledge today! But ever wondered how all this was actually discovered? Let us go back in time, and have a look at the history of cellular studies."
Studying Biological Sciences,BtdqqX-zYnc,biology,"Biological Sciences at Bangor University starts really broad in the first year bringing everybody to the same level of knowledge so we look at things like diversity of the organisms and genetics and bioscience skills. In the second year we get to choose our own modules because we already know what we're interested in and we're introduced to more complex concepts of the area. And the third year we use the knowledge from the first and the second year to work on our dissertation projects. What I love the most about Biological Sciences is that it always changes so there are always new topics coming up or a new species discovered so you never get bored being a scientist really. At Bangor we have many facilities for studying biological sciences, we have Brambell building where we have laboratories to do practicals such as dissections and microbiology experiments. We have the Natural History Museum which all the students have access to and also an aquarium and also we have the main library for scientific books As part of biological sciences we can do a field trip module and we can go to places like South Africa or India or Arizona and study the species from the area. We also get the chance to do the local field trips where we study the environments around Bangor. At Bangor we have many lecturers who are specialised in in different areas of biology and I really like in the lectures when they talk about their own studies and research, I find that really inspiring. When I graduate I would like to go into the research work the university helps me with career advice and CV building workshops. I want to do research because the lectures really inspired me to do so. I am really enjoying my studies at Bangor so I would advise anyone who wants to become a scientist to come here. you"

The geometry of life: When mathematics meets synthetic biology,tTqmV5icnmI,biology,tiling patterns show up everywhere in nature in the structure of a honeycomb the skin of a giraffe or in the Petals of a flower now researchers have developed a new way of making patterns with cells locking them together like Legos to produce beautiful tiling Arrangements diversity of Arizona in Tucson has engineered E coli bacteria with synthetic adhesions proteins that sit on the surfaces of cells and allow them to interact with one another adhesives work like keys that fit into specific locks as bacteria multiply they form colonies that expand or swarm normally when two colonies meet they create one giant colony but when the bacteria with adhesives swarm together the two colonies form an edge where the keys and locks meet and that opens up some opportunities to get creative here the researchers engineered colonies formed by bacteria with locks to Glow green and those with keys to glow red they turn yellow where the locks and keys come together larger faster growing colonies with a key could grow around smaller colonies with the corresponding lock what's more by engineering cells to produce one of two different keys and two different locks they could start to create geometric patterns using mathematical principles the scientists could model where to pipette bacteria with different kinds of adhesions onto a grid Matrix this allows them to create a range of complex patterns the bacteria could also be used to make linear designs including the homage to the University of Arizona the researchers say that the adhesive technology could be used to design biomaterials or new tests for diseases they might even shed light on how life grew in complexity as single-celled organisms evolved into multicellular creatures [Music]
What Is Aerobic Respiration? | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,ZkqEno1r2jk,biology,"Respiration is just breathing right? Wrong! Respiration is the chemical process that supplies the body with energy for all other life processes. Growth and repair of cells, muscle contraction, protein synthesis, sending nerve impulses, absorbing molecules and active transport to name just a few. It happens in all living cells. Not just animal cells but also blood cells. There are two types of respiration: aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic means with air and so needs oxygen. Whereas anaerobic respiration doesn't need oxygen. Let's start by looking at aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration releases energy in cells by breaking down food substances whilst in the presence of oxygen. It is represented by this simplified equation... But don't forget the energy which is released. Glucose is broken down by oxygen to release the byproducts of carbon dioxide and water. Energy is released which is then used to make a special energy molecule called ATP. ATP is how energy is stored for later use by the body. Aerobic respiration happens all the time in all cells, usually in the mitochondria. Animals get the oxygen needed from the air, through their ventilation systems. Plants get their oxygen from the air through the stomata. Do you remember how photosynthesis works? Compare these two equations... You can hopefully see that aerobic respiration works in the opposite way to photosynthesis. Plants produce food by photosynthesis and then through respiration release energy from it. But don't be confused: whilst plants do release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis they don't necessarily take in this oxygen for respiration. They just take in any oxygen from the air. Plants respire throughout the day and night as do animals. But they only photosynthesize during the day when there is light available. So this is how aerobic, or with air, respiration works. You just need to remember that glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen, to release carbon dioxide + water and energy. In the next video we will have a look at anaerobic respiration and how it differs."
The Central Dogma of Biology,9kOGOY7vthk,biology,"The DNA double helix contains two linear sequences of  the letters A C G and T, which carry coded instructions.  Transcription of DNA begins with a bundle of factors assembling at the start of a gene, to read off the information  that will be needed to make a protein. The blue molecule is unzipping the double helix and copying one of the two strands.  The yellow chain snaking out of the top   is a close chemical cousin of DNA called RNA. The building blocks to make the RNA enter through an intake hole.  They are matched to the DNA - letter by letter - to copy the gene.  At this point the RNA needs to be edited before it can be translated into a protein. This editing process is called splicing, which involves removing the green non-coding regions called ""introns"", leaving only the yellow, protein-coding ""exons."" Splicing begins with assembly of factors at the intron/exon borders,  which act as beacons to guide small proteins to form a splicing machine, called the spliceosome.  The animation is showing this happening in real time. The spliceosome then brings the exons on either side of  the intron very close together, ready to be cut.  One end of the intron is cut and  folded back on itself to join and form a loop. The spliceosome then cuts the RNA to release the loop and  join the two exons together.  The edited RNA and intron are released,  and the spliceosome disassembles. This process is repeated for every intron in the RNA. Numerous spliceosomes remove all the introns so that the edited RNA contains only exons, which are the complete instructions for the protein.  Again, this is happening in real time.  When the RNA copy is complete,  it snakes out into the outer part of the cell. Then all the components of a molecular factory called a ribosome lock together around the RNA. It translates the genetic information in the RNA into a string of amino acids that will become a protein.  Special transfer molecules - the green triangles - bring each amino acid to the ribosome. Inside the ribosome, the RNA is pulled through like a tape. There are different transfer molecules for each of  the twenty amino acids, shown as small red tips.  The code for each amino acid is read off the RNA,  three letters at a time, and matched to three corresponding letters on the transfer molecules.  The amino acid is added to the growing protein chain and after a few seconds the protein starts to emerge from the ribosome. Ribosomes can make many proteins.  It just depends what genetic message you feed into the RNA."
From DNA to protein - 3D,gG7uCskUOrA,biology,here is a cell the basic unit of all living tissue in most human cells there is a structure called the nucleus the nucleus contains the genome in humans the genome is split between 23 pairs of chromosomes each chromosome contains a long strand of dna tightly packaged around proteins called histones within the dna are sections called genes these genes contain the instructions for making proteins when a gene is switched on an enzyme called rna polymerase attaches to the start of the gene it moves along the dna making a strand of messenger rna out of three bases in the nucleus the dna code determines the order in which the free bases are added to the messenger rna this process is called transcription before the messenger rna can be used as a template for the production of proteins it needs to be processed this involves removing and adding sections of rna the messenger rna then moves out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm protein factories in the cytoplasm called ribosomes bind to the messenger rna the ribosome reads the code in the messenger rna to produce a chain made up of amino acids there are 20 different types of amino acid transfer rna molecules carry the amino acids to the ribosome the messenger rna is read three bases at a time as each triplet is read a transfer rna delivers the corresponding amino acid this is added to a growing chain of amino acids once the last amino acid has been added the chain folds into a complex 3d shape to form the protein you
What is Synthetic Biology?,dfYu-FVgSYE,biology,"What is it life? What makes it different from just matter? Everything living or not is just chemicals made from atoms. These fish and the water of the fishery in are just soups of atoms but what makes the fish alive and not the water, is how the atoms are organized, by a special kind of molecule and you know this because you learned about it in high school... DNA. The double helix molecule that houses the chemical alphabet of A's and C's and T's and G's. Which in different combinations can make a flower or a frog for you. Every living creature has its code that makes it grow, reproduce and change. DNA turns dust into life and how it does that I will now here's the mystery. 20 years ago scientists learned to read a creature's entire DNA sequence beginning to end a genome it's called they did this for simple things like bacteria, and then for more complex flies, and eventually for humans. And then they began to tinker to take the glow from a jellyfish and transfer it to account to make critters do what they'd never done before. And as biologists got better at this as Stanford professor Drew Endy, a new kind of science was born: ""called synthetic biology it's a means to an end."" What can we do with the new tools of synthetic biology? Well they can improve on what's been spelled out over 3 billion years of evolution. We can take it beyond reading genomes or editing genomes and start writing genomes our own ideas of what life should be like making creatures drastically different from any that have ever existed. And how do you do that? Well already one group of scientists have rewritten and rebuilt the entire instruction kit for the very humble little yeast. And they plan to put their new recipe into a cell and if everything goes according to plan it will come alive and begin making baby yeast exactly like it's most unusual parent it will be new in the world. This synthetic yeast will break the continuous chain of evolution that links every creature back to the first living cell it will be discontinuous in a way, a thing unto itself. And then where do we take this new technology,? How far should we or will we go?"

introduction to metabolism | Biology basics|,0wkhe0yfCBA,biology,"Welcome to moomoomath and science. In this video I would like to talk about metabolism. You may have heard that you have a fast metabolism or a slow metabolism. But what exactly is your metabolism? Your metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions within the cells of living things. Take a look at this summary of all of the chemical reactions taking place in a human. It is a little confusing. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into pathways in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, with the help of enzymes. An example of a pathway is cellular respiration in which glucose and oxygen are transformed into carbon dioxide water and ATP which is used for energy You can break metabolism down into three main categories. The chemical reactions used for the conversion of food to energy The conversion of food into building blocks used to make other items like proteins The chemical reactions needed for the elimination of waste Enzymes are crucial to metabolism Enzymes help speed up chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all chemical reactions in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life There are over 5000 chemical reactions that occur in plants, animals, and microbes that are controlled by enzymes. Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Many chemical reactions focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy during digestion and cellular respiration. These chemicals can also be joined together to make DNA and proteins. So there you go metabolism the sum of chemical reactions that take place in living things.

Biology and Self Organization,ZJ272i1Bhqo,biology,"So I've been thinking a lot about this idea of biology as something with almost a kind of agency, right? A kind of directionality. Not to get metaphysical here, but you could actually think of the 10 trillion cells that self organize and collaborate to become the meta organism that is a human being means that biology seems to exhibit a kind of protoplasmic yearning, a desire to self organize. There seems to be conditions in this universe that engender novelty, complexity sprouts, mind emerges from matter and then starts to manipulate matter at the level of the atom with nanotechnology. It's like human beings seem to be the cutting edge, the evolutionary pinnacle of self awareness becoming aware of its becoming, right? It's almost like the birth of mind folds the attention back and looks at its own heritage and starts to put itself into context. The universe comes to know itself through human beings. We've decommissioned natural selection, Edward O. Wilson says, and now we must look deep within ourselves and decide what we wish to become."
Introduction to Bone Biology,inqWoakkiTc,biology,"The human skeleton gives the body its shape and provides physical support for the systems contained within. It also forms part of the musculoskeletal system that enables us to move. The structure of bone is optimized so that it is strong but relatively lightweight. The interior of bone is composed of bone marrow. It is surrounded by two major types of bone tissue: cortical bone, or the hard, outer shell of bone, and trabecular bone, the spongey-looking center. The amount of each type of tissue in bone is dependent on the function of that bone. The basic unit of cortical or compact bone is the osteon. It is composed of successive, concentric lamellae. This structure contributes to bone strength by resisting bending. Cells called osteocytes are distributed within the concentric lamellae. Osteocytes form a complex network that is thought to be important in maintaining the viability and structural integrity of bone. At the center of the osteon is the Haversian canal. These canals contain blood vessels and nerves. The blood vessels within bone facilitate the exchange between osteocytes and the blood. Trabecular bone is present in the interior of some bones and resists compression. Osteocytes are also contained within its structure, and again play an important role in sensing local changes in strain. Trabecula are covered in a layer of flat and lining cells that are thought to be involved in the dynamic process by which bone is formed and broken down. Bone marrow is found within the interior of bones. The surrounding trabecula and vascular network provides structural support, nutrition, and a waste removal system that a heterogenous group of cells found within this space. Bone marrow is a site for hematopoiesis, the process by which the cellular components to blood are formed."
Biology | Academic Programs | Chaffey College,aQrPitQ7q_I,biology,"SARAH CHAMBERLAIN: I'm Sarah Chamberlain. I teach biology here. Also am a former Chaffey student. [MUSIC PLAYING] As a student at Chaffey, you'll have the opportunity to study all areas of biology from cell and molecular biology, modern molecular biology techniques, through animal behavior studies, even being in the great outdoors learning about how organisms interact with one another. ALI ALKHUDER: My name is Ali Alkhuder, and I'm a biology major at Chaffey College. I think the professors are great, especially the biology professors here are all really wonderful. Every one of them that I've had are just very patient with you. SARAH CHAMBERLAIN: Chaffey has counselors who know a lot about STEM. And we have a lot of faculty who advise students. ALI ALKHUDER: Everyone's been super friendly, very helpful. The facilities are great. There's a lot of materials that you can use to learn different things. You get out of it what you put in, and the professors are there to support you. SARAH CHAMBERLAIN: The Zoology Lab is a very special place. We have an incredible collection, both on display and also stored, maintained specimens. All of it is accessible to students. ALI ALKHUDER: The labs are really hands-on. If you feel like you're not really ready to cut something open and look inside of it, they walk you through everything. And especially my professor, she helps us a lot with identifying stuff inside the organism if we're dissecting something or if we're looking at something through a microscope, identifying different things on the slide. We learn a lot of lab practices that we use in the future. SARAH CHAMBERLAIN: It's incredibly rewarding introducing students to ideas that they haven't thought about before. I really hope that when they leave, they are even more curious than when they started. ALI ALKHUDER: Overall, I've had a wonderful experience here at Chaffey as a biology major. And I'm sure you will, too. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
What are the Branches of Biology?,2z8AaRpZ6FI,biology,"BRANCHES OF BIOLOGY Hey there, I am biology and I have knowledge about all living organisms. And I am mother of twelve children. My first child is Cellular Biology that studies the structure and function of cells. The other one, Molecular Biology, studies the biological processes on a molecular level. Evolutionary Biology solely focuses on biology from an evolutionary point of view to predict how biology will evolve. Bio-engineering builds products by using engineering concepts applied to biological systems. Cardiac stunts are an example of this. Marine Biology is responsible for studying all the creatures that live within the marine environment. Medical Biology studies all fields that are related to illnesses, alterations, and functions of the human body. Mycology studies solely fungi. Zoology is responsible for the study of animal life as a whole. Botany; it deals directly with the study of plants. Microbiology deals with the study of organisms that are invisible to naked eye. Here is Environmental Biology, which deals with the way in which all the living and non-living elements of the environment interact with each other. Last but never the least: this is Astrobiology, the branch of biology concerned with the effects of outer space on living organisms and the search for extra-terrestrial life.

What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,6LAT1gLMPu4,biology,"Eutrophication is the process that can happen in a water body, like a river or a lake, when too many nutrients are added to the system. Eutrophication starts with fertilizers, which are rich in nutrients like nitrate and phosphate, are washed into the river or lake system. This leads to an increase in nutrient concentrations in the water. The nutrients are food for algae. The algae grow and reproduce quickly, forming a thick green bloom in the water. This algal bloom will absorb sunlight shining on the water so the sunlight can't reach the bottom. Plants who need this light to photosynthesis will die. The algae will also start to die when they eat up all of the nutrients and run out of food. Next, bacteria start to breakdown the dead plants and algae. That releases more nutrients back into the water continuing the Algal Bloom Cycle. The bacteria, with a continuing supply of food, reproduce into much larger numbers consuming oxygen as they grow and respire. There is not much oxygen in the water to begin with so when the bacteria consume it quickly it might run out completely. Water without oxygen is called Anoxic. If the water turns anoxic all non-bacterial life in the water, including fish and other animals, will die. So, eutrophication happens when nutrients are added to water which causes an algal bloom, cutting off sunlight and feeding bacteria. The bacteria use up oxygen in the water which becomes an anoxic, causing everything living in the water to die. Eutrophication is one reason why we need to be carefull with fertilizers when we are growing crops."
Variation | Genetics |  Biology | FuseSchool,jUHokSPkzT8,biology,[Music] look at these cute baby animals you will have immediately observed how cute and fluffy they are but you will also have noticed that they are different they vary yes some are puppies and some are kittens there is a great deal of variation between species but also there is variation within a species one puppy is fluffier than the other they have different color fur and the kittens have different colored eyes variation is the differences in the characteristics of individuals in a population it can be due to genetics the environment or a combination of both let's start with genetics different members of a population have different dna unless they are identical twins this means they have different versions of genes called alleles and these alleles give rise to different characteristics for example on the eye color gene this kitten has an allele for blue eye colour whereas this kitten has an allele for brown eye colour if the species reproduce by sexual reproduction the random mixing of alleles from both parents result in extensive genetic variation within a population of a species this means that some individuals are better adapted to their environment than others allowing natural selection to take place for example in a population of rats some will either have better eyesight than others these will be able to avoid being eaten by predators so are more likely to survive to reproduce and pass on this advantage to their offspring if you want to learn more about natural selection watch this video some examples of variation in humans that are controlled by genes include eye colour and blood group if you have a blood group a it's because you have the alleles for this characteristic this is genetic variation and it is something that you were born with and nothing can change it some variation is due to the environment or lifestyle of the organisms examples in humans are hair length it depends on how short you decide to cut it your accent as this is linked to where you live and if you have any piercings tattoos or scars these are characteristics that you acquire throughout your life many characteristics are due to a combination of both genetics and the environment for example the height a person can grow to is determined by genetics tall parents tend to produce tall children however a person will not grow to their potential height unless they eat a healthy balanced diet also there is some debate on how much intelligence is due to genetics or the quality of education a person receives is intelligence more due to nature or nurture to answer these questions scientists can do experiments using identical twins if the characteristic in both twins is the same then it is most likely due to genetics if it is different then the environment has played an important role for example identical twins will have the same eye colour as this is only due to genetics but they will have different personalities talents likes and dislikes and this shows that these are also influenced by the environment so in this video we learnt about variation and how it can be controlled by genetics the environment or sometimes both if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe comment below if you have any questions why not check out our fusco app as well until next time

Spatial Biology Revealed with the GeoMx DSP by NanoString,mVhfZq8ppbc,biology,"We all understand the value of quantitating  protein or gene expression levels in cancer,   neuroscience, and more. However,  in addition to quantitative data,   spatial context is central to gaining  deeper insights into the tissue biology. What if you could see both spatial context and  quantitative expression data all from one slide? NanoString's GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler  platform provides morphological context with   high plex protein or gene expression profiling  from just one slide. A single slide sample   is manually or automatically stained with  fluorescent reagents to targeted areas of   the tissue which allows the GeoMx DSP instrument  to capture images with morphological context. With an intuitive interface,  you can then select areas of   interest for profiling using several  approaches: by tissue morphology,   by phenotype, by individual cells, by  gridding, or by contouring the area. The key to the GeoMx DSP technology lies with  the photocleavable oligonucleotide tags that are   attached to the antibodies via a light-sensitive  linker. UV light is used to decouple the High   Plex oligo tags from the antibodies or RNA in  the selected regions of interest. Oligos are   then retrieved from the surface of the  tissue, without disturbing the tissue,   thus allowing the sample to be reused.  The oligos are then deposited into a   microtiter plate where they can then be put  on an analyzer for quantitative analysis. Now it is possible to get both morphological   context with high profiling protein  and gene expression data from just   one slide sample. Experience GeoMx Digital  Spatial Profiling technology by NanoString."
Duke Department of Cell Biology - About Us,S8ylgpLmStE,biology,"One of the best places in the whole world to come to study receptor signaling was here at Duke University and that's really what drew me to the Cell Biology program is the interesting collaborations the Cell Biology Department has and the investigators within the Department. I had never experienced joint lab meetings and then in coming to Cellbio this was the first time that I had lab meetings with other labs and it was really interesting to see all of these labs coming together and it was the type of collaboration that they would have never had had they not had any joint lab meetings.    We cover a very broad area of topics in the Department. This is one of the exciting things about it is it's not just focused on one area but covers a broad spectrum of research. We have here at Duke within the Cell Biology Department so many different investigators working on different angles and basic Cell Biology principles all the way from the most simplest model system you could work with all the way up to mice and rats and and higher mammals And, we're really really fortunate that any microscope than we could ever need is available to us, any adaptation to the microscope can quickly be added on. The staff in the microscopy core are incredibly knowledgeable and they'll help you perform any experiment that you need to. Once you've manipulated your favorite gene there's any endpoint you can imagine that you could find here in the Department that you can start to study it. Success and moving forward into independent positions doesn't only depend on their scientific research and the number of papers they published. There are many other skills which are quite hard to learn and really require a lot of very dedicated mentoring by our faculty. So even though I had very little I had a very small skill set when it came to some of these questions I was interested in, the mentoring around me was such a great caliber that I was able to quickly come up to speed and learn these techniques. The people in the Department work exceptionally hard, the lights are on way into the night. I've also people come in very early in the morning. There's a lot of dedication and commitment to their research but also people like having fun. The grad students here in this Department are a really laid back group. It's not a really a competitive environment. It's a very helpful and collaborative environment. The folks go out to the bars on weekends. We have pub crawls every year.

Kidney Disease and Dialysis | Health | Biology | FuseSchool,9KZHowze7lg,biology,[Music] meet the kidneys those fist-sized organs that are shaped like beans they are kind and hardworking organs located in your upper abdominal area attached to the back of the abdominal cavity on either side of your vertebral column your kidneys have four important roles so luckily we have two of them they are essential for excretion cleaning your body every day as it passes through them by removing urea and other chemicals however sometimes your kidneys may fall sick this may be self-inflicted such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol or taking drugs or might occur as a result of another illness such as diabetes or experiencing severe injury that leads to a bacterial infection this can cause kidney failure which is when your kidney can not function properly anymore leading to a buildup of waste products in your body as you can imagine these waste products are dangerous and then staying in your body for too long can cause serious damage to help relieve the kidneys of this duty patients can undergo dialysis for about four hours three times a week so what happens during dialysis patients sit in chairs much like a lounge chair a needle is inserted into the patient's vein and untreated blood stops flowing into the dialysis unit let's follow this blood to see how it gets cleaned a pump pushes the blood through the dialysis tubing which is partially permeable to ensure that large particles like blood cells and proteins can not leave the tubing the tubing is suspended in dialysis fluid or dialysate dialysis fluid is a special solution of pure water electrolytes and salts it contains no urea or waste products no waste in the dialysis fluid means as the blood flows through the tubing a concentrated gradient is created allowing waste products to be removed from the blood and into the dialysis fluid by diffusion the dialysis fluid also contains electrolytes and salts to help correct any other imbalances in the blood that may have arisen from the kidney failure also making use of concentration gradients and youjin sometimes glucose is also included in the dialysis fluid either to remove excessive fluid from the blood or to provide the blood with more glucose if it's lacking once the blood is thoroughly filtered and cleaned it returns to the patient through their artery the used dialysis fluid is then disposed of while dialysis can replace the work of a failed kidney it can be very uncomfortable and time-consuming for this reason some people instead offer kidney transplants however while these proved to be a much better long-term solution as you will not have to eat a restricted diet or experience any discomfort they tend to be very expensive and finding a matching donor tends to be very difficult even if both conditions are met you still might be at risk of your body tissues rejecting the transplanted kidney which will require you to take immunosuppressive drugs so remember to take good care of your kidneys as they help keep your body clean and healthy at the video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe comment below if you have any questions why not check out our fuse graph as well until next time
Basic Molecular Biology: Basic Science – RNA Structure,9LoGaBqPkac,biology,"Ribonucleic Acid or RNA is  similar in structure to DNA   but is involved in very different cellular  functions. Similar to DNA structure, RNA consists   of the same basic elements, a sugar-phosphate  backbone, and four nitrogen bases. However,   there are three major differences that account for  the very different functions of the two molecules.  RNA is a single-strand nucleic acid  which, while more unstable than DNA,   allows flexibility to bend back on itself forming  weak bonds with another part of the same molecule.  Secondly, RNA has a ribose sugar  instead of a deoxyribose sugar like DNA   which is important for enzymes  that distinguish DNA from RNA.  Lastly, RNA has a uracil nitrogen base instead of  thymine allowing the base-pair complementary rule:   Adenine binds to Uracil, and  Cytosine binds to Guanine.  For orientation purposes, the carbon atoms  in the ribose sugar are numbered similarly   1 through 5 with corresponding 3 prime  and 5 prime ends. Adjoining nucleotides   add onto the 3 prime hydroxyl  group of the previous nucleotide.   Functionally, cells contain a variety of  forms of RNA including: messenger RNA or mRNA,   transfer RNA or tRNA, and ribosomal  RNA or rRNA. Each form assists in the   many functions of the cell such as coding,  decoding, regulating, and expressing genes."
Evolution by Natural Selection - Darwin&#39;s Finches | Evolution | Biology | FuseSchool,s64Y8sVYfFY,biology,"What are Darwin's finches and why are they so important to biologists? Study of finches led to the development of one of the most important scientific theories of all time, but how does this come about?   In December 1831 a naturalist called Charles Darwin boarded the HMS beagle bound on a surveying voyage to South America Whilst the ship and crew carried out coastline surveys Darwin was free to explore the islands in route in 1855 the Beagle arrived at the Galapagos Islands near Ecuador What darwin found there surprised him greatly? As well as giant tortoises and Marine iguanas don't collected and preserved a variety of different song Birds called finches Upon returning to the uk he examined them together with ornithologist John gould and later fascinating discoveries? The scientists observed that the birds were all similar to a single type of finch found on Mainland, South America Suggesting that these  mainland finches had originally colonized the Island however the Galapagos finches were all slightly different from the original mainland species and They were also different from each other the finches on each Island show distinct variations in their overall size big shape and claw size These differences were attributed to the different food sources available on the various islands of the Galapagos Some of the birds had long thin beaks and sharp claws suited to catching and eating insects while others had large powerful beasts suitable for cracking over the nuts Because of the distances between the islands breeding between different species of finch was unlikely and down Concluded that the finches must have evolved over time from the original mainland species to suit the conditions found on each individual Island in All 13 of the Birds brought that by Darwin who identified as being entirely new species all similar to each other but with definite variations from their common ancestor Darwin propose that the variations seen both within and between the same species arose by chance Variations which gave any individual comparative advantage made them more likely [to] survive and therefore reproduce out competing those with less Advantageous characteristics Darwin called this theory natural selection, and he published it [as] book on the origin of species in 1859 Evolution by natural selection is now widely agreed to be the most accurate theory to explain the origin and diversity of all life on Earth in this video you've learned how the finches of the Galapagos islands led to the development of the theory of evolution by [natural] selection Evolution of these birds still happening see what you can find out"
BTS DNA but it’s actually about biology and sung by a bored 15 year old,i6RGhnVfFw4,biology,"(instrumental) So I had this really great idea To help me study for my bio final The only problem, I forgot to make it Until after my exam yesterday (I made this a while ago) So in short I'm probably screwed And my grade Gonna suffer But, I can at least try to Impress my teachers and peers by Taking a song they think is trash and make it educational The nucleus Acts as the brain of all our little cells You know what's inside that thingy? It's holds all of our genetic make up So bascally if you'll be hot or pretty It's all decided in this tiny thingy All of our ribosomes Are tiny particles Of this thing science likes to call RNA It's found throughout the cytoplasm RNA I bet you wanted me to go and say DNA Chloroplasts Are the organelles that Capture energy From the sunlight And convert into Chemical energy In photosynthesis Why I even need to know this? I'm not quite sure either However I do know The chemical formula It's 6CO2 + 6H2O and light energy And once the whole process is finally done taking place (oh yeah) It's turns into C2H12O6 + 6O2 If you reverse this (photosynthesis) You get the formula for cellular respiration What that even is To be honest I'm not quite sure So basically if a plant lives or dies It will eventually impact our lives If all the plants are dead We'll all be dead to! Cause then we wouldn't have any OXYGEN We would surely all be very dead OXYGEN I bet you really wanted me to say DNA The mitochondria Is the powerhouse of the cell Oh please, did you really Think that I Would go This whole song Without Making that joke The mitchondria Is the powerhouse of the cell It takes all of your FOOD And converts into energy (for da cell) BIOLOGY Lala la lala Lala la lala Biology is very CONFUSING Lala la lala Lala la lala But it would really help if I HAD STUDIED (JK I did study) (I promise I'm a good student ;-;)"
Biology: Independent vs. Dependent Variables,nqj0rJEf3Ew,biology,"""Independent variable"" and ""dependent variable"" are important terms related to controlled experiments. Remember, a controlled experiment is a scientific test in which all conditions are kept constant except for the variable you're testing. The independent variable is the thing you're testing in an experiment. it's often abbreviated as ""IV"" and sometimes called the ""manipulated variable"" because you change or manipulate this variable. In an experiment, the dependent variable is the thing you're observing and measuring the thing you're anticipating may be affected as a result of exposure to the independent variable. It's often abbreviated as ""DV"" and sometimes called the ""responding variable"" because it responds to the change that you make. Let's look at a few examples. Suppose your hypothesis is that if students study 15 minutes a night then they will have higher test grades than those who don't study at all. What's being changed, or manipulated? It's whether or not the student study for 15 minutes. And what's going to be observed or measured in this experiment? What do you think might be different as a result of this increased study time? You're expecting test grades will be affected. In this experiment, the independent variable is the study time. And the dependent variable - the thing you're measuring or going to observe - is the test grades. Here's another example - see if you can figure it out. This time the hypothesis is that if people who have headaches take aspirin, then they will get relief faster than those who who don't take aspirin for headaches. So, what's the thing that's different in this case? The thing that's different - the independent variable - is whether or not somebody is taking an aspirin. Then, what are you going to measure? Your measuring how long it takes for their headache to go away. That's the dependent variable. Here's a final example to help you understand these terms. You predict that if a brand-name light bulb is left on continuously, then it will burn longer than a bargain brand light bulb used in the same manner. In this case, what is the independent variable? It’s the brand name light bulb. What are you measuring? You're measuring how many hours the light bulbs work before burning out, which is the dependent variable. The independent variable is the brand name light bulb, and the dependent variable is the amount of time the light bulbs work before burning out. So to review, the independent variable is the thing that you're testing sometimes this is referred to as the cause in an experiment. It is also the ""if"" part of your hypothesis. The dependent variable the thing you're measuring is the effect. It is also the ""then"" part of your hypothesis."
What Are Hormones | Physiology | Biology | FuseSchool,lRJE8c3ghRE,biology,what are hormones a hormone is a chemical messenger that is secreted or released into our bloodstream by specific organs known as glands hormones regulate or control many processes in our body including blood glucose levels water content in blood general growth and blood pressure just to name a few as an example thyroxine which is a hormone secreted by a thyroid gland helps to regulate metabolism in other lessons you will learn about a few of these hormones in more detail several hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland located right below the hypothalamus in your brain instructions are given by the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland according to current conditions in our body the secreted hormones travel through the bloodstream to target organs where either a specific response is directly produced or it stimulates or causes the target organ to secrete its own hormones we can think of this like a post office system hormones or posts must reach the correct target organs or addresses for the right response to occur feeling thirsty when the hypothalamus detects low levels of water in blood it signals or tells the pituitary gland to release a hormone called the anti-diuretic hormone or adh into your bloodstream adh travels to your kidneys in this case the target organ and causes water to be absorbed so urine becomes more concentrated and output is decreased drinking more water increases the water content in your blood which then causes the hypothalamus to signal the pituitary gland to secrete less adh less adh means your kidneys will absorb less water causing urine to become less concentrated and output is increased ever felt suddenly frightened when threatened the brain activates neurons that stimulate the adrenal gland located right above your kidneys to rapidly secrete adrenaline adrenaline then acts on your heart and lungs to increase heart rate and breathing rate this along with other physiological responses is known as the fight-or-flight response and is activated very quickly at the same time the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to secrete the adrenocorticotropic hormone which travels to the adrenal glands to secrete a hormone known as cortisol cortisol acts in target organs to allow the body to adapt long-term distress so to review hormones are chemical messengers secreted by glands into the bloodstream and produce a specific response when they reach the target organ you
Synthetic Biology at Northwestern: Developing Cell-free Biology Systems,o1MC79GKk2s,biology,"[MUSIC PLAYING] One of the things that our lab is specializing in is the development of cell-free synthetic biology systems. This is really important, because it allows us to decouple cellular objectives from what engineering objectives might be. Imagine that I'm a cell living in the environment. My goal is not to produce insulin for you. It's not to produce a fuel for you. It's not to produce anything else. My goal is really to live and survive. And so rather than have to worry about keeping the cell alive, we basically take a living cell, we rip off the cell wall, and we collect the guts of the cell. So this is like the machinery that might make the product we want it to make, or it might sense a small molecule within the environment that we would like to sense. So that can be really useful if you want to make, for example, a toxic compound that would normally kill a cell. Now you can take all the components of a cell that would make that compound, and deconstruct it, and then put it back together. So you can think of this like if you had a car, and we're going to basically open the hood up, take the engine out, and put it over here, and then play with it. I think one of the powerful aspects of designing artificial cells is that we will be able to use and incorporate imaging molecules that might be helpful for us to detect disease, therapeutic drugs that might be helpful for us to treat disease, and we'll also be able to use these structures to move into extreme environments-- high pH environments, high temperatures-- to detect and respond to different biological compounds that we're interested in."

Master | Biological Sciences: General Biology (track) | University of Amsterdam,8FqcwfuB6sM,biology,"This programme is unique... because it allows students to really create their own programme. So the key words here are independence of the students... and irrespective of what you as a student want... we will help you in reaching your goals. In this programme you start out with a couple of courses... but most of the time is spent on projects, into research... or for instance honing your skills into societal problems or communication. I think I chose General Biology because I have very broad interests within the field of biology. And this track really allows me to pick and choose different courses... from all the various disciplines within the broad field of biology. So I think that's to be the flexibility that the programme gives you as a student. You're allowed to take courses from all the different tracks in the biological sciences master's. But it also allows you to for example extend your research project... if you really love doing research or even honing other types of skills. I think I would say it's not a bad thing to sort of stay curious have very broad interests. It's a good thing to know sort of the direction you want to go in terms of a job in a future... But it's never a bad thing to sort of diversify your skills, your knowledge or experience. So stay curious I would say. So far I've mainly focused on learning how to do research. I've done research projects at the University of Amsterdam... and I'm looking for another project outside of the university. But I've also very interested in science communication... learning how to communicate the results of science... back to society through media platforms. And this track also allows me to combine the two... so I'm planning to follow maybe a science communication major... after I complete my research internship... so I can really learn how to communicate science back to society."
Welcome to The Biology of Human Cancer Course!,E-Y6GH7gaSo,biology,"My name is Daniel Benhamin. And I've been an instructor at UC Berkeley Extension since 2017. I'll be teaching the biology of human cancer. I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in the field of cancer metabolism, where I studied how cancer cells metabolize nutrients differently from normal cells. And by understanding these metabolic differences, I was able to work towards developing chemotherapeutic strategies to specifically target cancer cells and not normal cells. You should take this biology of human cancer course if you're interested in understanding the fundamental mechanisms that allow a normal cell to become cancer. And by understanding these mechanisms, we can then be in a better position to understand how to both prevent and treat this devastating disease. The field of cancer biology is one of the most rapidly growing fields in all of science. And that is reflected in this class. The things that we learn have, often, only recently been discovered six to eight months before the class has started. In fact, at some point in the class, we will learn things that haven't even been discovered right now. And we'll learn about them together as they are being discovered. The reason why I love UC Berkeley Extension so much myself is because we cater to nontraditional students. We understand that students have jobs and lives outside of the classroom. And we try to foster a learning environment that caters specifically to these kinds of students. So not only will students be able to interact with both me and their fellow students in real time, live online on Zoom, but they'll also be able to interact with their fellow students on Canvas via discussion. So they can post a discussion question. And students can come at any time they want and answer that question. And in fact, what I find so amazing about this course and about the students who take this course is that because they come from such diversity of backgrounds, they can learn so much from each other."
Basic Molecular Biology: Laboratory Practice – The Laboratory Working Areas,cmM8TZdgWXk,biology,Laboratory materials must follow uni-directional  workflow through separate working areas to minimize   contamination. In the first step of a specimen  processing the PCR reagent mix is prepared in area A. In step 2 the prepared mix is transferred to area  B. Never transfer any laboratory materials from   Area B to Area A. In step 3 nucleic acid extraction is performed in Area B where the extracted nucleic acid from the specimen is added to the PCR reagent mix. In step 4 the PCR product goes through  an amplification process in Area C. In step 5 the post amplification PCR product is analyzed in Area D.
Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology (UNIGE),RLgoafysfnI,biology,"The aim is really to understand the basics of life from whole organisms down to the atomic structure of biomolecules essential for living cells. This fundamental knowledge of how cells grow, divide, differentiate into tissues or organism is absolutely essential for us to understand the mechanism underlying some diseases such as cancer, and to develop in the future new therapeutic approaches. The Department studies different topics, from genome stability, gene expression and chromatin regulation to signaling and cell cycle processes. And to tackle this important problem we use a wide range of methods from genetic to genome wide analysis, but also using CryoEM to understand the molecular architecture of the cell to an atomic level. Studying basic research in which probably the clinical translation of that is still very far away is fundamental. Fundamental not only because it's the first step into developing something that will be practical, but also because it's in the very human nature, trying to explore unknown territories, either geographically or intellectually. Being curious is probably the most fundamental part of being a scientist and having questions to answer is the first step into answering them. I think that the most interesting thing about how to generate good questions it really starts like earlier in your career,  probably as a PhD student or even before. The Department has been a pioneer in developing electron microscopy and many famous scientists have been hosted in the Department over the past decades and had a substantial contribution  in our current understanding of basic cellular and molecular processes. My lab uses biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, super resolution and CryoEM to better understand how the cell divides and this at an atomic level. And we train our students with the most recent method and novel concept in biology to prepare them for the very rapidly evolving scientific world. We look for highly motivated and passionate students who want to step out of their comfort zone to undertake new challenging projects to better understand the really fascinating complexity of life and also uncover all the mechanistic details of how it all works."
Xylem and Phloem - Transport in Plants | Biology | FuseSchool,jtuX7H05tmQ,biology,"We could just say movement of water and minerals and movement of glucose and amino acids... But this is science, and so we like to have special terms to describe these processes! In these 3 part videos, we're going to look at the transport systems in plants for moving food, water and minerals around. We have a beating heart and circulating blood, but what do plants do? Cut a plant open, and it doesn't bleed. So what happens instead? Plants have their own systems. They have the Xylem which moves water and solutes from the roots to the leaves, and the Phloem which moves glucose, made in the leaves by photosynthesis, and amino acids to the rest of the plant. Here are the xylem and here are the phloem. Notice how the arrangement is different in the stem and the roots. The xylem and the phloem are found in groups called vascular bundles. And the position of these bundles changes for different parts of the plant. Both the xylem and the phloem are made up of rows of cells that form a continuous tube, running the whole length of the plant. The xylem vessels are made of elongated dead cells that are impermeable to water and have walls containing lignin (a woody material). Because of this, xylem vessels are tough. Which is why the vascular bundles in the roots are in the centre. They help prevent the plant being pulled out of the ground. They are also more protected in the centre. Whereas the stem has to resist being squashed and bent, and so it has the vascular bundles nearer to the edge to give the stem strength and support. The phloem vessels are made up of living cells. They transport sucrose and amino acids up and down the plant, depending upon where they are needed. Whereas, in the xylem the movement is just one way: from the roots up to the leaves. So we know that water and minerals go up the xylem, and amino acids and sucrose go up and down the phloem. But how? In the second part of this video we are going to look at the xylem and transpiration."

The Biology of Soil,sDMwJvxqqDQ,biology,"[Light, electronic music fades in.]  [Light, electronic music fades in.]  Dr. Claudia Goyer:  Soil is the home of a large variety of organisms... ...going from really large ones like insects and nematodes and earthworms... ...to the very small like bacteria and fungi. Narrator:  There are billions of organisms in every spoonful of soil. That means that there are more organisms in a spoonful of soil... ...than there are people on the planet.   They are very small but they are very important to maintain the chemical environment of our world. Dr. Claudia Goyer:  Soils are actually quite alive. Organisms play a big role in soils. They basically affect the chemical, the physical... ...and the biochemical properties of soil. Basically, all organisms are involved in recycling.   The process starts with larger organisms that will break down plant residue... ...and animal waste into smaller fragments and then the microorganism... ...will further break down these bigger fragments into nutrients... ...that can be taken up by plants. They play a vital role in keeping our soil really healthy... ...and ensuring that we're having a really good crop. Dr. Martin Chantigny:  Agricultural practices such as soil tillage, fertilization and crop rotation... ...affect the abundance and functioning of soil organisms. Dr. Claudia Goyer:  And all of those organisms very important for ecosystem functioning. Dr. Martin Chantigny:  Soil biological activity is active at temperatures well below freezing. Breakdown of plant material, manure, fertilizer, continues throughout winter... ..which affects nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon levels in soil and their fate in the ecosystem. Nutrient loses during winter may represent up to 90% total annual loses... ...which is far from being negligible.   This has an implication that the impact of fall application of manure and fertilizer may have on the environment.  Our goal is to develop farm management practices... ...that maximize retention of nutrients in the soil during winter... ...so we have a minimal impact on the environment and maximize the benefits to the next crop.

Pomona College Biology Professor Daniel Martinez on Gene Order Research,3sRA-wgP6cc,biology,"- [Narrator] Imagine four decks of cards, each with the same number of cards in identical order. Now imagine those card decks being shuffled continuously for 48 straight hours. What are the odds that when you finished all that shuffling, the cards in each deck would still be in the exact same order? Might not work for cards, but new research in the journal ""Science Advances"" reveals that after 700 million years of evolutionary forces, genes in animals are still found in the same order on chromosomes. The number of chromosomes varies widely across the animal kingdom. Humans have 23 pairs while fruit flies only have four. Dogs have way more chromosome pairs with 39 than cats with 19 pairs. No matter, the genes on the chromosomes are still arranged in the same order. Here's Pomona College biology professor and co-author of the study, Daniel Martinez, with a little more on this. - So it is an absolutely surprising finding. Chromosomes break all the time. They rearrange, they can get together and form another chromosome. I think that we expected there would be a lot more freedom from gene order to change. It is pretty amazing that animals have maintained gene order in chromosomes in such a neat way."
Marine Biology Department at California State University Long Beach,iJbowr0r9xA,biology,"So you think if I want to understand how life on earth works, I want to understand how life in the oceans work. We want you to do the science. You know we want you to experience that and know what it's like. In our program, undergraduates get a very heavy introduction very quick, and that is unique. You will be doing real experiments and putting yourself in a position where you can be published because of your undergraduate research project. You have a really immediate access to rocky inter tidal, sandy beaches, estuaries. We have small boats so we can go offshore. We have a diving program. We have access to a 76 foot research vessel so we can go offshore. First of all we have a long history. We've been doing it since 1969. We have over 900 alumni from our program and they're in every aspect of marine science that you could possibly imagine. And they're all over the world. One of the classes I teach is called marine ichthyology. It's the study of marine fish. And I get to actually teach this class out at Catalina. Students spend four weeks with me. They are completely immersed in marine fishes. And the great thing there is I can lecture about what fish do and about their biology and their form and function, and then literally an hour later they're in the water seeing it. There's no better place to learn marine biology than at a Marine Lab like that. We have a wide variety of electives that students take as they're graduating. Things like marine microbiology and marine mammalogy and wetlands ecology. Just so many different great marine electives and that's what really gets the students understanding and knowing kind of what they want to do with their lives when they graduate. I think one of the best things about our program is that the students get to go in the field as soon as they get here and they get immersed in marine biology. One of he most unique things about our program is that the students get to take marine biology their very first semester. And we're so close to the ocean that they actually can go on field trips to the ocean within lab time, which means that every student in every class gets to do field trips. We have a marine lab. That's one of our greatest assets. In there students can become research assistants or teaching assistants where they're teaching through the interactions with the organisms. I think students really walk away feeling more confident. In searching for a job and internship in my later years at school I had found that people that went to Long Beach knew people from Long Beach. They know the classes you take and they like what you know. So the classes here are designed to help us get the information we need to succeed in this major. The faculty here at Cal State Long Beach is really helpful. Their doors are always open too they will give you advice not just for classes but also just make sure you're on top of it for applying your next steps. Whether it's grad school or a job. I actually got a couple of my undergrad jobs through faculty that would reach out to me and say ""hey, this exists you should go do this."" They take care of you and they make sure you're doing what you should do to progress. They're actually doing science that it's actually real. It's reak data. It's not some made-up worksheet that they gonna analyze. And so you know that's a really, again I think a really exciting component of a lot of the courses."

"Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (MSc), DTU",WX9pX_NE6_Y,biology,"    On my bachelor I studied Biotechnology, so I designed a lot of lab experiments and I worked in a lot of different organisms, but one thing that was the same for every project was that I always had to do some sort of bioinformatics.   There is all this data out there. So like in the 90s people started sequencing the human genome, and it took more than 10 years and it cost 3 billion dollars and now you can do it in a day for... Yeah I think now even less than 1000 dollars. So biotechnology and synthetic biology has moved so much within the past decade and is still just developing exponentially, but that also means that we have to be so much better at analysing the data, because it doesn't help if you can produce the data, if you don't understand what it means, or can store it too... And I'm interested in working with these problems and analysing this data. I am a part of DTU's iGEM team 2015. It is sort of a collaborative community in synthetic biology so every year about 200 teams of university students all around the world make their own projects in their lab at their schools and then then they meet up in Boston in the fall and present these projects. It is a lot of work but of course, it is also very rewarding, because you get to be a part of this amazing community of students that are super engaged and super excited about synthetic biology."
Biology of SARS-CoV-2: Infection | HHMI BioInteractive Video,LoVJCx6XXMM,biology,"[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SPEAKER: This is the virus SARS-CoV-2. Its name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. You may have heard it called just the coronavirus, or COVID-19. Coronaviruses are actually a family of viruses that include SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 is the name of the disease caused by it. Coronaviruses infect humans and other animals. In humans, they cause the common cold and, in some cases, more serious respiratory diseases. All coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have a genome made of a single strand of RNA which is surrounded by a membrane made of lipids and proteins. This membrane is called an envelope. Coronaviruses are named after what looks like a crown of protein spikes that stick out of their envelope. Coronaviruses enter the body mainly through the mouth or nose. The virus then has to get inside a human cell. The protein spikes in the virus's envelope attach to specific proteins on the surface of a cell. This causes the virus's membrane to fuse with the cell's membrane, releasing the virus's RNA genome into the cell. The cell's ribosomes translate the virus's RNA into proteins, including viral RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase transcribes the virus's RNA, making more RNA copies that are translated into proteins. It also makes more copies of the virus's whole genome. The new viral genome and proteins combine to make a new virus that is packaged into an envelope formed from the cells membranes. Newly-formed viruses travel to the cell's surface and are released outside the cell. These viruses can infect other cells or leave the body in mucus and saliva droplets. This can all happen even if a person doesn't feel sick or show symptoms of disease. A fever or coughing are usually signs that the immune system is fighting the infection. The production of new viruses continues until the body's immune system is able to eliminate the infection. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
TXST Research - Biology Field Methods,grrdt22KA-E,biology,"(peaceful music) - Today, we're out here at Spring Lake, which is one of my favorite places, and we are gonna be catching some turtles and some fish through different sorts of trapping techniques that we're learning that are associated with our majors. This class is huge for us wildlife majors that want to go into the field of wildlife biology research and fieldwork, 'cause it's giving us techniques that we will actually use on the job. So it's preparing us for a career that is sooner than we think it is, actually. The techniques that I'm learning through this class, I get to put on my resume and they help me when I apply for jobs. I can tell them, not only am I interested in this research, I actually know how to conduct it, which makes it easier for me to get jobs and helps me feel more prepared for the career that I want to go for. So many of my professors have inspired me with their own journeys within this career and kind of showed me what I can do next. And they're always there to answer questions and help me out along the way. It's been awesome. (peaceful music)"
Major Minute: Environmental Studies,arxBrlPNu-Q,environmental studies,"(gentle music) - Hi, I'm Suzanne Crawford O'Brien, Chair of Native American and Indigenous Studies. - Hi, I'm Adela Ramos, Chair of Environmental Studies. - And hi, I'm Kevin O'Brien in the religion department. - [Group] And this is out Major Minute. (three beeps) - What does it take to understand climate change, or how human activity impacts geological formations, or how different cultural beliefs or political views shape our relationship to the earth. It takes interdisciplinary expertise and a robust place-based learning curriculum. These complex questions can't be answered by a single discipline or field. This is why, what makes our major unique in the region is in our last name. Studies. - Our interdisciplinary classes draw not only on many different perspectives but also on different parts of campus, to understand and to engage environmental challenges. You will wade into our local watershed, you'll analyze samples with a chemistry professor, make maps of the watershed with a geology professor, and reflect on the ethics of water with a philosophy professor. That kind of interdisciplinary work is essential for a healthy environment and for real environmental change. - Our commitment to place-based learning considers indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and how it should inform our approach to sustainability and environmental justice. Our campus is located on the traditional territories of the signatories of the Medicine Creek Tree, the Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, and the Squaxon Island Nations. - This interdisciplinarity (laughs) - [Man Off Camera] That's okay. (everyone laughs) This interdisciplinarity distinguish our students and alumni from other candidates when applying for internships, graduate school and the job market. We're proud to see how they transform their passion for the environment into careers at national parks, state and federal environmental offices, in the healthcare and education sectors, AmeriCorps and other not-for-profit organizations."
Environmental Studies One Minute Major,dRWeUQTh8u8,environmental studies,"(waves and sea gulls squawking) - Today's environmental challenges require an inter-disciplinary approach, so we help our students integrate perspectives and skills from sciences, social sciences, the arts and humanities in order to become effective change agents. We're located at the convergence of lots of different systems. Fields, forests, Chesapeake Bay, and within moments, we can step from the classroom into the field. - There's just no limit to what students can do because there's so many environmental issues that are facing the world and by giving them the skills to think critically about these issues and think creatively about these issues. They can take these skills into any career path that they want. - My favorite aspect of the environmental studies major was the fact that the major was so inter-disciplinary. I have primary interest in environmental sciences, however the major is designed for students to take classes outside of their concentrations. That sets me aside from other environmental scholars out there because no matter what your major is, you can have some sort of common ground or common interest in that. (upbeat music)"
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies,qgjqz5ig99Y,environmental studies,"The program is very flexible for the students. Students can really design their own program. Students can actually come in with the background that they have, figure out what their deficits are, what weaknesses they have, find the coursework that will help with that and then help them build from there into the areas that they are most interested in going out and working in. I'm doing a research together with UNICEF on their WASH programs. WASH is Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. So, we are trying to develop a sustainable financial model for making WASH successful in schools in developing countries. We have people, of course, from UNICEF who are participating with us on this research. We have some economists from Wharton school. We have students from different schools coming together with us. It's a very enriching experience to learn from people who have economic perspective on this issue. I really like my classmates in the MES program because they are coming from different backgrounds, and there are lots of international students, which is really amazing. Because when we study environmental issues, they have this global perspective in order to see what's going on around the world. They all come from these from professional backgrounds, from recent graduates, bachelor's degrees They all bring something completely different and everyone is really excited to share, and everyone is very open. So, we learn a lot from each other, and the classmates are really an amazing perk. The students in my concentration and certainly in the MES program have an opportunity to reach out and participate in a number of other CRO courses in different schools. They get involved in a number of different activities around the school that relate to sustainability. So there are a range of opportunities, I think, for our graduates to not just get a position, get a job, but also make a real contribution to how society then can evolve and move and be much more sustainable. Interdisciplinary work here at the MES program is in my opinion the best part of the program. It's part of why I came to this program, so I could explore some other areas. While I was here, I took classes in Negotiations and Conflict Resolution at Wharton. I took a Public International Law class at the Law School. Philadelphia is an awesome laboratory for students to work in. If you want to do policy, you can work with the government here in Philly. You can work on campus on sustainability projects. There are opportunities to get involved with ecology. Definitely come and see us! Meet our students, meet our faculty, come join one of the classes, come to one of our events, and really get to see the campus and the curriculum and what we do here. I think that there's something for everyone."

There's only a limited freshwater resource and if we keep polluting that well a lot of things can't be renewed. I actually would say the rouge river just, that's the main thing that I think about. you know it's something that actually shocked me and the things that you can do and  how it can easily be damaged. We need water to survive. There's also a lab for this course. a lot of science, a lot of math as well. chemistry labs, chemistry classes. I think it prepares you really well. it's very hands-on. It's very interesting. It's very fun. You do things that you never thought of doing. You know like, for example, finding the PH, the moisture of the soil. I'd say if you know you have  a small interest in science I feel like you'd really be interested in wanting to take more classes."

Major Exploration: Environmental Studies at Amherst College,WfivxHpI9WQ,environmental studies,"So my work is primarily focused on conservation of tropical forests, mainly in the Amazon basin. What I learned doing work with indigenous communities, with government actors, with scientists trying to advance conservation in tropical rainforests. Is that to do it successfully, you need to have a strong understanding of science, an understanding of society, of how people work, an understanding of politics. And it all needs to come together to make environmental progress. To make environmental policy that works for people and that works for the planet. In environmental studies I have taken classes in philosophy, sociology, history statistics, biology. As a geologist I have been able to teach a number of courses that deal with geologic time. That is the 4.5 billion years that the earth has been here. Those courses deal with the interplay of the climate over that period of time. But in environmental studies I'm able to take that one step further and deal with climate change in the ways that it is affecting humanity today and projecting those changes out into the future. Climate change, biodiversity conservation, marine management. All of these issues require students to be able to approach a problem from a variety of different disciplinary lenses. The Environmental Studies major starts out with training in subjects including history, statistics economics, political science and policy From there students take elective courses where they're able to follow along with a particular pathway of interest. Between the core requirements and the electives I get to choose, I can pursue any different avenue I want and and get a good mix of different classes So Environmental Studies pairs well with a lot of majors. It was flexible with my schedule. It was classes that were flexible with my interests. Get a taste for philosophy or or maybe even get some real-world application with statistics, all through the environmental lens. People I met in the intro classes and throughout like outing club and other extracurriculars on campus, who also happened to be majors. We would discuss stuff outside of class that was just of relevance to us. It felt more like a community than a lot of other majors who just took classes together. You going to also find a lot of different people, like even within the major. The diversity of students and like the perspectives they bring to the major is really cool. Whether you're interested in getting involved in policy, getting involved in doing cutting-edge ecological research that's gonna help us solve the climate crisis, whether you're interested in learning more about renewable energy. This is a place that can create opportunities for you, not just in the classroom but outside of it. I was really fortunate and lucky to have the opportunity to go to Ghana and to do research there on the ground understanding of what does the agricultural development strategy for Ghana look like. From a national level all the way down to the district in the village level and talking to people. I was really able to get it appreciation for what it is they're going through, how the project the agricultural development projects are helping them, what the shortcomings all the projects are. And that was cool because I can then marry that to what I did in the classroom in Global Environmental Politics whether it's going out into the field and doing work with communities, and there's opportunities to do that. Or going to more established policy think tanks over your summers to try to understand what it is that the most innovative people and thinkers are doing to try to confront climate change and develop renewable energy or protect threatened ecosystems. This is a place that can plug you in to these cutting-edge spaces for innovative thinking and action at the end of the day."
Purchase College Environmental Studies,PW5b-jggZkc,environmental studies,"(happy and bright acoustic guitar music) - The way I go about preparing students is I try to demonstrate for them, by example. I mean I try to give them some time to experiment with it. So that when they get done, they don't just know facts, but they know how to get to the right answers. And that's far more important than just knowing the right answers. (happy and bright acoustic guitar music) - So all the ENV professors are like really, really hands on and like really always willing to go above and beyond for their students. They're always available, always open for any questions, any answers. Dr. Taylor literally went outside with me to help me with my senior project half and hour before he had a meeting in dress pants, dress shoes and a button up and trudged through the mud with me. So I can honestly say I do not think there's anything he would not do for his (laughs) students. - Our students are pretty awesome. And we have a really fairly small program, so we really get to know all of our students. I had a whole bunch come to Maine with me this past summer to do field work. We want to plan this garden that we're gonna plant, which is all them kind of outside of class time just being interested. Getting students out in the field and doing things outside and really engaging with what things look like in the real world. We try to get them doing a project that would be similar to what they would do in a masters program or in a Phd. So, it's intense. And we're really in vested in all of our students succeeding, so that's something that you're not gonna get at a huge school. And that you get here. (happy and bright acoustic guitar music)"

Binghamton Major Minute - Environmental Studies,IkHdPiOe2rk,environmental studies,"[Music] Hey. My name is Eliana Ebstein. I'm an Environmental Studies major. Today, I'm in the Greenhouse at Binghamton University. And, I'm going to tell you about my major in 60 seconds. So, when I was a freshman I was very confused about what I wanted to major in. I thought I maybe wanted to be in business school . . . It turns out I hated it. I found geography and through geography, I fell in love with environmental studies. My favorite class so far, has been ""Ecological Agriculture."". My professor has his own farm. So, he teaches us in a very hands-on approach. And, on Thursday, he's actually bringing in some worms. I could take home for my compost bin. Outside of class, I'm involved in Binghamton Food Rescue . . . which is an organization that reallocates food from supermarkets and farmers markets . . . to people in need within 24 hours. Also, next semester I'll be studying sustainability abroad, in Costa Rica . . . which I'm pretty excited about. Something that surprised me about this major was how well I can integrate it into my daily life. I changed the kinds of foods I eat and the activities I engage in. In 5-10 years, I see myself abroad with a Master's Degree in Public Administration . . . managing a nonprofit that utilizes recycled textiles. And, that is Environmental Studies in 60 seconds.  "

Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies Testimonial: Alison Fetterman,NlC7U1uGgLQ,environmental studies,"My name is Alison Fetterman. My concentration is environmental biology. I have a bachelor’s degree in biology. After my bachelor’s, I went on to work. I worked at a bird observatory for about seven years, working on field studies with songbirds doing nest searching and banding and learning anything you can do in the field with birds. I wanted to move on further, so I looked into master's degrees and found that Penn was a good match with their field studies. I wanted field work. I wanted to work with birds. I wanted flexibility and so, this program checked all of the boxes and it has really... it's been amazing. The classmates is one of the big perks of this program. They all come from these, from professional backgrounds from recent graduates, bachelor's degrees. They all bring something completely different and everyone's really excited to share and everyone's very open. So, we learn a lot from each other and everyone is open about it and they want to learn from each other. So, the classmates are really an amazing perk."
Environmental Studies at UVic,Wqi229BSOIw,environmental studies,"Well I think what really sets apart in environmental studies is that there's a really strong focus on experiential learning. A lot of the instructors in the environmental studies department make a really strong effort to give their students a play-spaced education, where they're not just in the classroom, but they're studying in an outdoor environment. When you're talking about, you know, environmental issues, you really need to be out in the community, but also exploring the social and political, and even economic aspects of that, and trying to wrap that all together into an integrated lens. Our courses engage some of our primary environmental challenges, like climate change, and explore how we can solve some of these vaccine challenges. UVic has huge potential as a living classroom for learning about restoration and food systems. We have the legacies of different historical landscapes. We have Coastal Douglas-Fir forests. We have Garry oak meadow systems. And then we have all those spaces that come together to create this unique, patchy environment, where we can learn about different types of eco-systems. How they interact? What are the possibilities for each one? It's an awesome place to learn."

Why I Chose Earth and Environmental Sciences,fd0jpf-X5Bs,environmental studies,[Music] hi COS of 2024 I just wanted to say congratulations I'm accepting your offer to environmental sciences here at McMaster it is an amazing program one of the things I love about it is how close you get to the people in your program as well as the professors as well as the earth science one geo three labs they are so fun you get really hands-on in in the field and you guys are gonna rock it get it Rock fun anyways hi my name is Lucas and I'm a fourth year student and environmental sciences the reason I chose the master university is because of all the academic opportunities in class through school of Earth and environmental science has to offer the most exciting part happens through the hands-on field courses where your classroom can go from the standard style here in Hamilton to the aquatic caves of the Bahamas while you first-year students out there don't forget to have fun and good luck after completing the Gateway program you can apply into any level to science program including the three offered by the school of geography and earth sciences which can prepare you to meet the course requirements to be certified as a professional geoscientist in Ontario I chose the earth and environmental science program because I wanted to have the freedom of customizing my degree to fit my goals whether you love chemistry ecology and climate sciences or government policy making and the fight against climate change you'll find a world of opportunity which will allow you to explore incredible fields of study and prepare you for a truly engaging future broaden your perspective of the world with a tightly knit earth and environmental science community the small program size allows for no shortage of experiential education opportunities such as internships and co-ops and there are many courses and labs that will train you to address environmental challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective [Music]
Environmental Studies Course Puts Students to Work in the Field,GaJeBtQjo_w,environmental studies,"[Music plays] So the specific research that I'm doing, I'm gonna be working on the soil composition to find out what will grow best here, and we also wanted to find out what's growing now, was the goal. So we came out and we did a survey of the area, and we counted plants to see what's growing now and how we can help other things that are native grow here too. We're working with the Boise River Enhancement Network and the City of Boise to help rehabilitate a 12-acre hillside of the Hyatt Hidden Wetlands Reserve here in Boise. It's a hillside that's just completely overgrown with invasive species, and we'd like to see it have more native bunchgrasses and annual forbs. We're really trying to show the value of wetlands, especially in urban settings like here in Boise, so what part of my research is is to collect air particulate samples throughout this 44-acre site and then compare them to other sites down the road and I want to use those particulates, see what the pollutants are, and kind of show that they are improving air quality and we should really care about wetlands and care about improving our environment by wetlands. What we're working on is measuring air quality levels around Boise and comparing them to a stationary monitor that's located in Meridian. And what we're kind of doing is we're looking at how air quality varies over a wide spacial area, as compared to just a single stationary monitor. So, greenbelt, obviously, the levels are much better than you'll see downtown. Downtown it tends to spike around rush hour, major intersections like Front and Capitol Street. Over here the air quality's a lot better, I would say. The intent of the research is to kind of see how the particulate matter and the air quality changes basically over really short distance. We're finding that there is, depending on time of day and what block you're on, there can be huge disparities, sometimes hundreds of times greater particulate matter 2.5 in the air from block to block, which is really interesting. So far that's a lot different from what I expected. That thing that I really want to find out is just how big of a difference there is between traveling on the greenbelt, like coming in downtown, because that way sensitive populations, it's nice to know if somebody wants to bike to work, what is the best, healthiest way for them to be getting to work, getting around where they need to go. We don't have enough information to say anything definitively yet, but once a year has rolled around, we can make some assumptions about how things change seasonally. [Music plays and fades out]"
Environmental Studies Class Attempts Sustainable Lifestyle,3Ho8GmsudQM,environmental studies,"I aim to go zero-carbon, yes, but also zero-waste in the ground zero-pollution in the air, zero resources sucked from the Earth, zero toxins in the water. I didn't just want to have no carbon impact, I wanted to have no environmental impact. Okay? And that's what no impact is supposed to be about. Transportation... Food... Energy... We want to bring cloth napkins, so that we don't have all the paper waste, and we want to bring Tupperware for leftovers so you don't waste any food. And in the dining halls, don't get a lunch tray unless you absolutely have to, because that wastes a lot of water to wash it. If you could take the stairs, just do it, taking the elevator isn't going to help your health in any way and taking the stairs will energize you before class and it might be a pain if you're all the way up on the fourth floor, but it's four flights of stairs. You can do it. And I think one of the important things that you guys had, or at least said last week, was that if something is broken, try to fix it first. You know, if you have jeans with holes in them, maybe you can get them patched first before you decide to go out and buy, buy new jeans. This is a problem for a couple of reasons. I mean, it takes a while to get rid of Styrofoam, we know that. The other thing is: look how much space this takes up. So, if we take up a lot of space with this, it's not biodegradable, it's going to last for a long time, so let's try to avoid Styrofoam next week. This is what is in my toolkit for no-impact week. I've got my mug, that I use in the mornings, okay, Here's my plastic container which they mentioned, Here's my water bottle that I'll take around, Bryn mentioned cloth napkins, I've got two,  'cause I'm messy, I found out last year when I did no impact that I make a lot of mess, and I'm constantly using paper towels, so I have two this year. Hopefully that will get me through it. This is for my composting items, okay? So, if I go around- like this morning I had a banana peel, I'll keep it in here, and then again, we're going to do composting in the classroom."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies Testimonial: Tony Wang,GAXQC7wLjyQ,environmental studies,"Hi! My name is Tony Wang. I’m in the MES program. My concentration is resource management. For my future career, I’m interested in sustainability. I believe in that innovation and technology are the future, so I want to do some kind of environmental consulting or environmental technology to solve some of the current environmental issues like resource management, water scarcity, like pollution, and also, like conflicts between human and wildlife. I really like my classmates in the MES program because they are coming from different backgrounds. And there are lots of international students, which is really amazing because when we study the environmental issues, we have this global perspective. We want to see what’s going on around the world. I would definitely say to study and to grow at the University of Pennsylvania, you definitely have to be open-minded to learn from your classmate, learn from your professors. And also you have to take the initiative to learn on your own, to study, to initiate your own independent project. That is kind of the way you are becoming more independent, innovative yourself. And you are carrying out what you’re learning into your career interests."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Meet the Students,GN882cirt8E,environmental studies,"Um, I think the most exciting part of my job everyday is coming in and seeing what these students are going to do next. They're doing everything. They're so involved. They're so engaged and, uh, the professors are willing to work with them and say, you know, someone comes in with a crazy idea, you know, I want to go do this and we're like, ok, how can we make that happen? And, typically we can make it happen. And that's the really fun part about this job is finding out, oh so and so just did this, so and so just did that. They just came back from this project or that project and, um, the way that they engage with each other and interact with each other, um, on these projects has been phenomenal. So, uh, they're working with each other, they're working with professors, and they're just really, um, they're non-stop. It's hard to keep up with them. So, our class comprises of people from various backgrounds and from various countries. So, that itself is, uh, an experience where you learn from each other. Which, someone has done supply chain management, so you learn, you learn from them on certain aspects but you get stuck on doing your project or understanding some things. People coming from civil engineering background, people from, um, environmental studies core studies like geology. So, there's a lot to share. People from different areas, some have come from right out of the undergrad, some have 10 years of experience, some are still working, some, some with, some doing second master's. So, yeah it's been, it's been nice. But, but honestly, and I know it sounds cliché but the students are really the most phenomenal. Uh, it's an aspect of, uh, the community here. They come from all over the world, they come from all over the US and different experiences, different strengths, so I do feel extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to teach here all these years."
Environmental Studies at Lewis &amp; Clark College,2wErZgu79B4,environmental studies,"Environmental Studies is not a singular field. It is something that really is important in every single aspect of life. Beat that economics, beat that politics, beat that art or science being a part of ENVS is just a super amazing opportunity to pursue more dialogues where even though I'm communicating with someone who's completely different than me in viewpoint and stance I have the tools to have really productive and effective conversations where we both like come out having learned something. All of these really firmly held beliefs that lead to pretty kind of clear actions that we want to take might be and always are far more complex far more difficult in terms of solutions. I think like most people at Lewis & Clark you come into college thinking about how you can change the world, how you can make it a better place and I think environmental studies helps you really unpack what that means and how to accomplish your goals."
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Why I Chose Penn,FkVppFjp5D0,environmental studies,"Basically why I chose Penn was that you could actually tailor your own curriculum. If I wanted to do corporate sustainability, I don't have to limit myself to taking courses in biology or chemistry. I can actually take courses in law school or at business school or at public policy school. I chose this program because it's really a interdisciplinary program. It has different focuses, like sustainability, law, resource management, biology, maybe chemistry. So, I feel like for me to pursue a career in sustainability, I need to learn from all these fields. Interdisciplinary work, uh, here at the MES program is in my opinion the best part of the program. It's, it's part of why I came to this program, so I could explore, um, some other areas while I was here. I took classes in negotiations and conflict resolution at Wharton. I took a public international law class at the Law School. I actually didn't know I wanted to be a lawyer and wanted to attend law school before the MES program. I found out about the Penn program just searching online for master's programs. I wanted to go for a further degree. I wanted field work. I wanted to work with birds. I wanted flexibility. I needed, um, I wanted to be part-time. I wanted flexibility in my program to, um, to help me continue to raise my, my young family. So, this program checked all of the boxes."
What’s the difference between Environmental Science and programs in the Faculty of Environment?,wdq30WnbP-E,environmental studies,all right what was the line again so more enthusiasm get fired up evan let's go hi i'm evan and i'm graham and today we're here to talk about the differences between environmental science and the programs in the faculty of environment you can think of environmental science as the study between both the living and non-living parts of the environment and how they work together as a system this involves a study of biology chemistry and earth science and using that we can look at how the world was in the past how it works in the present and how it might change in the future programs in the faculty of environment look at various human and social factors as well as the science involved with environment and sustainability and this includes examining weather patterns looking at climate change geography resource management sustainability practices as well as even evaluating access to clean drinking water so overall you can think of environmental science as a pure science meanwhile the programs in the faculty of environment look at the societal and human impacts however there is a lot of overlap including labs oh yeah and you'll definitely get a chance to dive into these topics during labs in the end what's important is finding out what your interests are and picking the right program for you we recommend that you check out our environmental degree programs page online to learn more about all of our environmental programs at waterloo including co-op and career opportunities to really allow you to differentiate between our programs thanks for joining us [Music] i did i clearly hadn't practiced that part before
Why Environmental Studies?,ZyPgJQAUA6o,environmental studies,"Since I was a little kid I always loved animals and it always felt that it was important to protect the environment. Working for Lush and working on issues like the tar sands and having dirty oil, stopping dirty oil from coming to the European Union while I was there and campaigning against that.  With the inherently green environment of, you know, the Dutch atmosphere is what really inspired me to work towards, you know, greening my own life and focusing on an environmental future.  One, I wanted a theory based program but I also wanted the experience - that hands-on experience. I also liked the close-knit community that was in the Environmental Studies faculty I really wanted that and also the professors they're experts in their field and I wanted to learn from the best. I had a sort of careers appointment with York to try to figure out what was best for me and after explaining how much I loved the environment and I love working with animals or with nature in general they thought that FES would be perfect to me so I'm extremely lucky because this is all I applied for, this is the only university I chose, and I managed to get in and it's just been perfect ever since day one."
Environmental Sciences at USM,m29gIzk_USc,environmental studies,"We're a department of environmental science and policy and so we offer two programs, one is Environmental Planning and Policy, the other is Environmental Science. and the premise is the people who go on to do planning and policy, need some basic environmental science, about which they're doing planning and policy and similarly the people who are studying environmental science, well, environmental science takes place in the real world, and most of it is done in consequence of policy; Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, hazardous waste. So we kind of marry both of those with the basic sciences. With biology and chemistry and geology things like that. Most of our students, one of the things they have in common is they like to be outside. another thing they tend to have in common, is they like to do things with their hands. - I had no idea I'd be interested in researching insects. I got into the department after taking the introductory environmental science course, my freshman year. And then my professor Dr. Staples hired me as a research associate. Where I started doing research with insects. The introduced pine sawfly lays its eggs on many different pine species, but in Maine primarily it defoliates eastern white pine. The larvae emerge from the eggs and start eating the needles. - I've learned a lot about insects which weren't necessarily what I had anticipated being interested in. I wasn't interested in that at all when I came here. I kind of stumbled into the program after taking the 101 course and immediately I know it's what I wanted to major in. I'm looking at the rates of parasitism of the introduced pine sawfly cocoons. To find out whether it's parasitized or not when the insect emerges, whether it's the pine sawfly or the parasitoid and the parasitoids emerge from much smaller holes and different species create different types of holes while they are emerging. -  When our students graduate and they enter the real world what they've done is they do not generally right term papers in this major. You write an assessment report, you write a land management plan, you write a soil analysis. So when they leave here, they leave here with a toolkit, a portfolio, of tangible products that they could show a prospective employer. And this also works fine for graduate school because doing practical things includes covering the theoretical. - As an undergraduate you really don't get to experience going to these conferences and I'm going to be going to my third conference which is just amazing. Getting to meet all these experts in the field and getting to make these connections I would never would have made before. - I haven't had any published papers yet but I learned very very quickly, how to write scientifically with being exposed to it and hopefully if everything goes well with this study and we get more data in the summer and might be able to publish this research. Which would be amazing"
Overview of Environmental Studies 100,zOeVJQxM2Zc,environmental studies,"Hello, I'm Catherine Walker and I'm going to talk with you a little bit about Environmental Studies 100. It's a course that covers the major causes and consequences of pollution, natural resource depletion, and the loss of biological diversity. The major objective is to develop a better understanding of our natural environment and the human impacts that degrade it. We also want to look at how we can take measures to protect and to restore environmental quality. The authors of our textbook, Miller and Spoolman, state that Environmental Science inspires and equips students to make a difference in this world. They emphasize natural capital, natural capital degradation, solutions, trade-offs, and the importance of individual actions. It is clear that humans have a definite roll in the health and sustainability of our natural environment. We are consumers of natural resources and we should protectors of our environment. By examining how nature works and how we interact with nature, we have a say, a stake in what the future holds. I hope this course does inspire you to be that protectorate of the environment and and I hope that we learn new ways to work together for a better future. Thank you."
Environmental Studies at Temple,fQ7UwfPjwKY,environmental studies,"Environmental Studies is really focused on looking at the relationship between people and their environment, or humans and nature relations. Given the global environmental challenges, we really see this major as important for training students to address those challenges in a variety of fields, from academia to policy to advocacy. I chose Environmental Studies because out of my work with City Year through urban gardening and working with kids, I kind of became more passionate about environment issues but specifically in the city. You can understand the world in a better way than you ever would in any other major. Most of our classes are small. We spend a lot of time on advising and career preparation, finding internships for students. I’ve worked for the Office of Sustainability for the past three years as the outreach assistant there and I also helped start the Rad Dish Co-op, which is a student-run cooperative café on campus. There’s nothing like Rad Dish in Philadelphia at any other university. All of our food is sourced locally and seasonally. The idea for Rad Dish Co-op was completely student driven. They found me and then they took off. Our students are really passionate about making a difference in the world. They want to make the world a better place, but they want to get a job and a meaningful job that helps them to do that. And our students do that. We provide the skills and training necessary. With the GIS Certificate and a lot of the stuff offered in the department, you can have that opportunity to learn what you need to do to make cities greener. I definitely feel confident coming out that I could go work in the city and make it awesome."
Environmental Studies at Lewis &amp; Clark is Unique,BiP2O233vwA,environmental studies,"Hi there I'm Jim Proctor I'm a  geographer and I'm Professor and   Director of the Environmental Studies  program at Lewis & Clark College.   I'd like to name four things that make our program  distinct, they all start with the letter I. First we are highly interdisciplinary, our major  draws upon fully eleven contributing departments   across the natural sciences, social sciences and  humanities, and my colleagues Jessica Kleiss, Liz   Safran, and I help you weave together the concepts  and skills that you learn in those courses. Second, we are highly international, drawing  upon our international campus community   and our acclaimed overseas and off-campus  programs. Yes ours is a green campus,   but we want you to experience this big  world and we give you opportunity to do so.   And then to bring home those experiences to  inspire your work in Environmental Studies. Third, we're highly innovative. We don't believe  that you will be able to successfully address   the environmental issues you  will face today and tomorrow   with the approaches of yesterday. And  so we will challenge you to cultivate   new concepts and new skills to address the  issues that you will face in your lifetimes. Finally we're highly individualized. We  give you the opportunity to pursue a custom   area of interest in our environmental studies  major, this is an area of passion and expertise   you wish to develop upon which you will do  a capstone exercise in your senior year. So those are the four things- we are highly  interdisciplinary, international, innovative, and   individualized. Come check us out! And feel  free to be in touch. Thank you so much, bye bye."

Discover Natural Resources &amp; Environmental Sciences in ACES,ItYjgReNGZo,environmental studies,"[Music] I started environmental science fully driven to law and policy. I thought for sure I was going to be an environmental lawyer, environmental law or education or somewhere in that realm, but one single experience switched it around for me and now I'm a fish biologist. I think NRES is a wonderfully collaborative and integrated department. I think there is a really wide diversity of what you can research, what you can learn about within one department, so of course if you're more interested in things below the soil, you can research that. If you're interested in things growing from the soil, you can research that. If you're interested in the animals and people that eat things that grow in the soil, you can research that as well. Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences some of the things that we focus on really involve water, soil, plants, animals, and people and all of those, and how they interact in the ecosystem. NRES to me just makes such a creative, curious person at the end of it because I learned stuff about soils. I learned stuff about aquatics, plants, birds, mammals a little bit of everything so like that really helped me be able to like challenge myself. We have world-class faculty that have done anything and everything you could possibly imagine and they're one of the biggest resources for our students. There's so many opportunities to get involved because the faculty is willing to work with a freshman and teach them because they want to help mentor. The teachers are some of the best people I've ever met in my life. NRES is literally a whole bunch of people who are super nerds and they do exactly what they love to do, that kind of leaks onto you and that kind of passion is very well reflected and it made it exciting in class every day for me. I think NRES would be for you if you really care about the environment. You really care about making an impact and a difference. What I know my students walk away with is a very well-rounded environmental education in all of the different disciplines that we offer. All of that is going to make you applicable for almost any job in regards to natural resources. I would love to be super contagious about the field of environmental science and natural resources. I would love to spread the word about how awesome it is to be sustainable and live a sustainable lifestyle to walk around proudly with your reusable metal straw and your reusable tupperware. If students ultimately want to change the world, I can't think of a better major to ultimately give you the direct skills to be able to do that. There's no one who is not rooting for you at the school. [Music]"
The Environmental Studies Program at the Brock Environmental Center,-4XAUzxdc6I,environmental studies,"This is the dawning of a new day for learning  in Virginia Beach City Public Schools.   The sand, the sun, the surf--it  redefines what a classroom can be.   Who needs walls when you have this space to learn.   Don't get me wrong, the Environmental  Studies Program has walls,   but instead of being connected to a school, we're  connected to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Brock Environmental Center. It is the  tenth Living Building in the world. This program has really helped me broaden  my sense of what I want to do with my life. To be able to have these opportunities, like  looking at this all, you wouldn't even think   it's a classroom, you know. And I really like  the emphasis on how it's not just in here, it's   everywhere, all your surroundings outside.  You've got the Bay right there. All the   wildlife from that, just hearing the sounds and  everything in the morning. It's so peaceful and   I'm really excited to be here, so. Here you get a chance to expand your horizons and   because students attend half day and  either the a.m. or the p.m. cohort,   you get a chance to collaborate with students  from around Virginia Beach, but also maintain   connections to your high school community,  your friends, your sports, and your clubs. I've never been so engaged in school,   and like, I get up to go to  school, which is like, rare for me. Sustainability and environmental  science are the heart of junior year.   Immersed in hands-on learning experiences  that are rooted in inquiry and curiosity,   students aren't just in the role of answering  questions they're posing them and conducting   authentic investigations to find answers with  creativity and innovation or learning by doing. I feel like it's still a great gateway to learn  how research works, uh, what a self-maintained   schedule and, uh, like work ethic is because I  feel like school does not set you up for that.   And cause like you have these assignments  to do in high school, but like in college   you have the same but like, you have so much  more freedom that it's really hard to take in.   I feel like getting this with internships in  the program itself is a really good preparation. Junior year is all about redefining what  a classroom can be. It's about breaking   boundaries and personalizing learning. About  seeking happiness and finding joy and adventure.   Senior year takes that a step further by  giving you the opportunity to personalize   an alternative classroom embedded in the  community. This is learning with meaning. This right here could be your classroom. go ahead  fill out the application and apply right now."
Study Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham,G8pFroRdMEM,environmental studies,[Music] an environmental sciences degree from the University of Birmingham will give you the knowledge and the skills to understand and solve the world's most pressing environmental problems finding answers to real-world problems will make you highly employable they have multiple opportunities to help improve your employability for example you can take final year placements in a range of organizations including businesses charities and governmental organisations the structure of the course is very adaptable in the first year you'll take all core subjects and these will give you the core skills in environmental science which includes field techniques but also programming and other ways to use a computer to help you solve problems in the second and third years you can choose much more of what you want to do in particular there are three main themes firstly there's environmental risks secondly there's at the global environment and thirdly there's the living planet so you can choose the stream that's right for you so not only will you work on things that really interest you but you'll also be able to tailor your CV to the jobs that you want we have a wide range of field courses with which to take your learning outside the laboratory and the lecture hall for example you might study pollution mediated ecology in Switzerland or in your final year you might go to Delhi to look at the chronic air pollution there or you might go to China to look at water science you'll be taught by world leading academics using state-of-the-art facilities including the new collaborative teaching lab you'll also have the chance to work with these academics and help them with their research the research in the school spans all seven continents so for example you could help me with my work on air pollution in East Africa or in India or more close to home we could look at air pollution in the West Midlands or within Birmingham you could look at forest ecology and the effects of climate change on forests by using our new woodland to the north for Birmingham this woodland is being pumped full of carbon dioxide to see what the effects of climate change will be in the 50 years time we also have world leading research facilities and nanoparticles water science and air pollution so together with the rest of the environmental sciences team I look forward to working into the University of Birmingham you [Music] you
Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies Testimonial: David Groff,ggHSPSdnyD8,environmental studies,"My name's David Groff. I'm a part-time MES student here at the University of Pennsylvania. I am getting my Master of Environmental Studies in environmental biology and I'm an employee at the University of Pennsylvania as well. A lot of the programs have field trips, which is wonderful because you actually get to go out hands-on and actually see what you're working with instead of sitting in a classroom looking at a slide. I've gone to Puerto Rico for a class, Puerto Rico Field Ecology, and learned about the four different major ecosystems down there and how they're all impacted by development, climate change and tourism. If you have a chance to take them, take as many different field classes as you can. Getting out there and seeing the different aspects from a wetlands site and then going back to the same spot later and seeing it from an ornithology site as two different comparisons is absolutely amazing."
50 Years of Environmental Sciences at UEA | University of East Anglia (UEA),3UsQbVj531g,environmental studies,[Music] but school was established in 1967 and in that time there's 50 years the school has very much contributed to the whole development of the discipline of the environmental sciences and we particularly from you know the the word go took an interdisciplinary approach so one of the great things about the school is the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration I don't think a lot of the work on the national ecosystem assessment and everything that's followed from it would have happened if we'd not have geographers and economists working in such close proximity another example is the way in which some of our social scientists have worked with earth scientists interested in volcanic hazards within the school of environmental sciences we have a very strong theme in natural hazards in particular our Volcanology group have been involved in large projects which interact with local communities that might be impacted by volcanic activity climate change is an area of research that has changed fundamentally in the 50 years since the school of Environmental Sciences began here at UVA 50 years ago climate change is thoughtful or something that changes on geological timescales tens of thousands to many millions of years now it's been firmly established that climate changes on timescales affect individual human lives and research here at URI a has established those changes and also the principal causes of them the Tyndall centre is a network of universities in the UK with the headquarter its headquarter at au Yale and we're thinking here about getting society and people to use less energy or energy more smartly or to switch to renewable energy which is really critical in terms of addressing an issue like climate change the international policy response to the global warming problem has been to establish the limits of supposedly safe global warming there at URI a were very proud of the fact that our global temperature record has been used to monitor global warming as approaches these limits of one and a half to two degrees Celsius so one of the things I most love about teaching here in the school of environmental sciences is taking our students out on field courses we're very committed to getting students out of the classroom and into the field and teaching them real practical skills for collecting data making observations and learning how to do analysis very exciting for me as the head of school at this time to see this your breadth and depth of research and teaching activity I'm very proud of that opportunity to hit the school particularly in this year when we've been awarded the Queen's anniversary prize for further in higher education that's a great accolade and one that recognizes these 50 years of endeavor in developing and promoting environmental science and translating our search into doing something better for the environment in terms of protecting the environment for future generations are great accolade and one that is very much well earned as the school the staff the students of this 50 years have made a real big impact and we can see that both internationally nationally and locally so we look forward to continuing that great effort in the next 50 years [Music]
Graduate Studies in Environmental Studies,25fW_yYSJoQ,environmental studies,"[ Music ] >> My experience as a graduate student at Queen's has been incredible. I've worked collaboratively with a variety of professors on campus, I've been fortunate enough to travel for field work internationally, so those experiences have been incredible. >> It's been really a very positive experience. It's a very tight-knit community, very supportive, and a lot of broad research areas that bolster your own research. >> We have research going on in the hard sciences, social sciences and studies, chemistry, biology, toxicology. We have projects in the humanities. We're joint with geology and geography. It's limitless, and that's one of the true benefits and powers of this school. >> Queen's School of Environmental Studies really offers students an opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals that are fully committed to environmental sustainability. We really appreciate working in multifaceted teams for research that is both theoretically grounded and empirically evidenced. So, what we're really wanting to do is ensure that environmental issues are seen from a big-picture perspective, and that we train our students around professional development skills that helps us translate that knowledge into the public, private, and community realms. >> Our graduate students have a variety of career paths they can choose from. We range from industry to government and non-government organizations. We have students go on to med school. We have students go on to work for Natural Resources Canada. It's not just academics that our students work on. There's really endless amounts of opportunity, and one of the best things about our program is that students can really get out what they put into it, and we're always sure not to limit their dreams or goals after their graduate studies. >> Graduate courses in this program are designed to challenge the way that you would normally think, so coming from my background, I had to really challenge my way of thinking, and fostering really critical thinking was really important in my education. >> I think one of the things that I value most about our school is the collaborative nature, and the open-door policy between students and professors. I've learnt so much through both formal and informal dialogue with professors in this school. [ Music ]"
Meet Rachel – Environmental Studies Major at Salisbury University,xj7hCjncf18,environmental studies," My major here at Salisbury is environmental studies. After taking an environmental science course in high school, I realized that I really had a passion for environmental issues and decided SU was the perfect place to study the environment. The environmental studies department, as an interdisciplinary program, really stood out to me as different from among the other schools I was considering. The department really does a great job of connecting students with their professors. And not only are they your professors, but they're your mentors and almost your peers in a sense too. I see that our major is really kind of like a small family of people. We just enjoy spending time together, from going on camping trips at Assateague to taking trips together downtown to Third Friday. The students and professors are just always looking for ways to interact and get to know one another. One of the great benefits of environmental studies at SU is that it's environmental studies and not environmental science, meaning that we cover a variety of disciplines within our program requirements. So not only do we talk about the natural sciences and the physical sciences, such biology, chemistry, and geography, but we also talk about the humanities and we take courses in philosophy, in art, in history. And so all of those courses are focused on the environment. But at the same time, we graduate with this broad understanding of environmental issues. And it really is a program that allows students to develop your individual interests. One of the things that's really unique to the environmental studies program is the senior seminar capstone project. My class right now is working on a project focused on climate change. And we've decided to look at how climate change is specifically impacting Wicomico County. Sometimes in environmental studies, you get the feeling of being bogged down. And you learn about everything humans are doing to harm the environment. And you're just like, oh, gosh. What can I do to help? And this class gives you that sense of almost forcing us in a way to get to know our community and meet with people, meet with community members, or the mayor. One class is doing something with the city of Berlin. It gives us this sense of empowerment-- that you leave with this uplifting feeling that you can really make a difference in the world.

Studying Environmental Science at the University of Arizona,HiC1lMiOAAw,environmental studies,"I didn't know what I wanted to do out of high school. And so for a few years, I just messed around, not really driven to do anything. But I knew I wanted to do something, and I always flirted with environmental science. It's a big motivator to protect our environment and help keep our water clean. Getting outside of the lab or getting outside of an office, and getting into the field and seeing the wetlands here at Sweetwater, seeing the trees, seeing the birds, sometimes seeing a rattlesnake, it can be pretty fun. This has definitely been a pivotal point in my life. Having the opportunity to study at the University of Arizona, be able to contribute, that's been a lifelong dream."
"Michelle Wunderley, Point Park alumna of the M.S. in environmental studies program",ZSanicWrDzE,environmental studies,">> Michelle Wunderley I'm Michelle Wunderley and I work for Enercon  Services Incorporated out of the Murrysville  office and I am a Point Park Alum. First, it was an accelerated program. I just finished  up school so year long was extremely appealing to me. The Environmental Law and Environmental Policy class really  stuck out to me that a lot of other programs didn't have. This degree has really helped me because it taught me  the regulations and laws that I need to use during my job,  so the Environmental Law and Environmental Policy  class have really helped me quite a bit. This career path is extremely relevant because it's such  a hot topic with drilling, climate change, air quality  issues from the past, steel mills, things of those nature.  If you're enjoying science, it's a great way to jump in."
Plattsburgh Programs: Environmental Studies,LTrVKGFfjMM,environmental studies,"Hi, my name is Isabel Gomez. I'm from Trinidad  and Tobago. My majors are environmental science   and environmental plan and management. I chose  my major just because of the environmental   changes going on in this world, with like  climate change, and I want to be a part of   changing that and helping it. Because  of where SUNY Plattsburgh is located,   being so close to the Adirondacks, Lake  Champlain and Vermont, we've got to experience   a lot of new things that I wouldn't have anywhere  else. This semester was actually one of the   best semesters I've ever had. I got to see  wild animals like wolves, bears, coyotes, hawks   and it was just an amazing experience. I see  myself in five years back in the Caribbean,   working specifically on the island of Barbados.  I want to work closely with their environmental   department to help their small island become  more environmentally sustainable. I just feel   so fulfilled leaving this place knowing that  there's so many opportunities for me out there."
Laurier Arts: Geography and Environmental Studies,F8PaZ_uzRPs,environmental studies,"it really is one of those touch stone of what it means to be Canadian. The whole mythology of Wayne Gretzky learning on the backyard rink that his dad built for him and it's just I think something that Canadians do and cherish very much. You know flooding the backyard going for skate is a great way to, to spend the winter. The fact that people can you something that they're passionate about like outdoor rinks and contribute to a scientific project, I think that people find that very exciting and interesting to be apart of. We're born scientists and there's no reason that it shouldn't be a normal part of our life and that we shouldn't enjoy it. Rink Watch is a pretty simple website to navigate if you have a rink in your neighborhood, an outdoor rink that you skate on regularly, pin its location on our interactive map and then come back on a regular basis and report if you can skate or not based on the weather conditions. people might be a little bit surprised at a project like bring watch would come a Faculty of Arts. We've made environmental researcher priority here so that we're contributing to the broader conversation in Canada and internationally about how the natural environment is important to our quality of life and how some other things that we're doing have impacts on the natural environment as well. The great thing about citizen size for data collection is that we have a wider reach and we have more people involved and we have more data volume. For a given area we may have one weather station at the airport but we may have 500 rinks and so the very fine scale spatial resolution variation in temperature is where we can start to resolve by using this rink data. We see this as a starting point and not as a finishing point and so in the coming years here at the Laurier Faculty of Arts and in the Department of Geography environmental studies what we want to do is to build an ethos across Canada and across North America that all of us are scientists we all need to pull together"
Environmental Studies - A Global Perspective | CurtinX on edX,rAcgOGQv8Sw,environmental studies,"PROF BALSER>> Those of us who are alive today were born into a world that is changing faster and facing more challenges than at any other time in history. There are those who say the problems can't be fixed. But some of us know better. We know it can be turned around. But it will take the efforts of all of us - spanning areas like science, technology, arts, policy, law, even philosophy … crossing international boundaries and cultural divides. It may seem daunting – but it can be done. Every day, all around us, people are changing the world. This course is a chance to join with a community of people all around the world that want to help solve the problems. In it you're going to have a chance to learn some the basics about Environmental Studies that we need to know in order to address the challenges that we face. A little knowledge really can go a long way, so if you're interested in making a difference, I invite you to join us and help make the world a better place."
"Orman Morton III, environmental sciences | Oregon State Ecampus",3N0PtcluDl8,environmental studies,"My name is Ormon Morton. I'm an environmental scientist, I deal mainly with water quality. A lot of the work that we do involves us going out into the field and spending a significant amount of time in the field collecting data. You know as a Native American, that's, that's, that's my second home. That's where I want to be. I chose Oregon State because Oregon State presented an opportunity for me to achieve an environmental science degree that was rather rigorous, that would push me. And then the other was the Native American community here. I was invited back to attend the State of the University Address in Portland and then come to visit the campus. It was very overwhelming to be able to physically be in the Native American Longhouse and have that sense of community and family. I've only experienced that on my reservation. We are a close-knit community, we look up to our elders as mentors. We're close to our families. Any Native American who wants to pursue a degree online through the Ecampus program at Oregon State needs to be aware that the Native American Longhouse is a resource that's available to them, it's a resource that allows them to touch out to Native students that are here on campus. It was very exciting for me to have the opportunity to come back to the Oregon State University community and interact with the students. It was an incredible experience and I look forward to my next visit."
"Meet Kira, she studies Environmental Science at UQ",TyidzTeehjY,environmental studies,"Hi I'm Kira and I study a Bachelor of Environmental Science at the University of Queensland. Environmental Science is looking at the world how it's elements interact with each other weather it is the earth, the plants, the soil, the water, the atmosphere, and you also get to learn about the issues that these things are facing. And also the amazing benefits that they can give to us. UQ ranks as one of the worlds top universities for environmental science. I chose UQ because I think it has such a beautiful campus, as well as really good links to research, so even if you're not interested in working in research your still being taught by people that are making the ground breaking discoveries in the field and have that really good knowledge to translate it to you. A lot of people know that the environment right now is facing a lot of problems, but also that it's really important for us to manage because its critical for our survival. Going into environmental science is really important because it allows you to understand the issues in depth but also how to communicate that to broader management context and the every day person that might not want to go into research but still wants to understand the kind of impact they can have."
"Study Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management",zncVM_zt-Dk,environmental studies,"I chose ESPM because it's a very interdisciplinary  major. I knew I wanted to do something   science-related but I was also really interested  in policy and how policy impacts us as people and   our overall environment. This was kind of the only  environmental science-related major that kind of   leads you into working in policy and government  and I realized that that's the best way that I   can be a part of creating change in our society  and our environment. I'm interested in ESPM   because I really like the environment. I  like being able to go outside and be hands-on and because it fit the different things  I was interested in which is people,   plants and policy and then this is a really good  major to really marry all those ideas together.   So ESPM is the University of Minnesota's premier  interdisciplinary environmental science major and   there are four different tracks and you get  to pick where you want to go, what you think   is going to fit your skills the best and what's  going to suit your career goals. I think in this   field specifically you need to have a wide set  of skills. You need to know the technical stuff,   the science knowledge but you also need to know  how to communicate with people to work on a team   to be a leader to collaborate and so I think ESPM  and the classes and the faculty have really helped   me develop those skills. I think the best part  about the ESPM major is a lot of my classes have   some sort of like lab or fieldwork component  where you're actually outside you know working   with plants or the soil or water and you're really  using what you learn practically and there are a   lot of research and internship opportunities  outside the classroom, so it's really easy to   visualize what my career is going to be like  and it's just, it's just a lot of fun. Well I   want to work in the government one day whether  it's for an agency or in the state legislature   and I think that the U has really great  connections to that type of work and it's also   taught me what I need to know to work in  policy. As I build my career and kind of go   forward into the working world I hope ESPM opens  up a lot of opportunities for me to help people.   That's something that attracted me to this major  is that I can make a difference in the environment   and I feel like it's really rewarding to  be able to just work in that everyday."
Earth and Environmental Sciences - Quarry Field Trip,BiyFxhESkPM,environmental studies,"Today we've checked out our first open-mine quarry so we'd been to Nenthead originally and checked out some kind of harder harder geology, but today was just going along and talking about the management of a quarry I went to a lot of different universities and read up on the course and the course content and stuff and it was very theorectical whereas Newcastle is really applied and the fact we're in the North-East means we've got accessibility to loads of different mines and that kind of thing so everything we learn in a module we then get taken out and shown how it applies to the real world and today is a great example of that we've been learning about the economic sustainability of extracting limestone, whether it be for construction or agriculture and then we've been taken to an open-cast mine and spoken to the manager Everything I do, it gets the context through the kind of industrial links that Newcastle's got so I'll be learning something and going: that's really interesting but I'm not sure how I'd ever get a job in that or make money through that but at the end of each module we then get taken out and shown how what we've just learned applies to the real-world So personally for me I find Earth Sciences at Newcastle really hands-on there's a lot of different field-trips we go on of all the ones I have previously been on I actually really enjoyed the one today for me personally mining and quarrying is very interesting to me since its such a large-scale operation it's really good to get an insight on how everything works, everything runs it's also useful to see as well for the environmental impacts the mining today actually did give me a great insight into an actual mining operation and maybe that is something I'd like to go into in the future I'm not a hundred percent sure what I want to do but I do think that these trips and going to places and speaking to people who have worked in the industry kind of gives me a direction and kind of gives me an idea about what I'd want to do myself"
"Meet Ibrahim, environmental sciences student",pwN3QPJB4cY,environmental studies,"Ibrahim Aburaneh: Hi, my name is Ibrahim Aburnaneh, and I'm a fifth-year environmental science co-op student. Today, I'm going to talk about why I chose my program. I chose my program because, if I'm being very honest, I'm very indecisive. I actually knew that I wanted to do environmental sciences, but I was afraid of commitment, especially at 17,18. It was a big choice to make. At Guelph, environmental sciences offers a first general year before you get to declare your major. The major options are environmental sciences, ecology, environmental economics and policy, and environmental resource management. And ask me then I had no idea what you were talking about, but ask me now, I'm very confident in my decision, and I'm very happy with where I ended up. And that was really because of that first year. I choose to stay involved at Guelph because, as a co-op student, sometimes it feels like you're missing out, especially when you're away on co-op, and that is not a feeling that I want to experience ever. So I made sure to make it a point to be involved as much as I can. I'm involved with the OAC at my college. I work on the OAC Instagram account. I'm involved with ESSE, the Environmental Science Student Executive, because those are my people. And I love discussing topics of environmental sciences. I'm very passionate about that. And finally, I'm a peer helper because if not giving back, then what are you doing in my opinion? And for those experiences and for that, I'm so thankful. I love this question. This is my favorite question. What advice I'd give to my first-year self? I'd tell myself to just relax. Honestly, I think I was really high strung. I was really nervous, even though everybody told me not to be. I was just up the wall asking a million questions all the time, which is totally fine. But I would say, ""You know what, take one big breath, and it's going to be okay. And make sure you plan your courses a little bit further ahead than you originally had because that will be a struggle later on."""

Penn&#39;s Master of Environmental Studies: Why Study in Philly?,asTbJBZ2QaI,environmental studies,"Philadelphia is known as the City of Brotherly Love, so loving our planet would make sense starting in Philadelphia as well. We have the Schuylkill River, which has gone through multitudes of changes from pollution over the years, um, from the Industrial Revolution on forward. Um, now we have green trails and we have the Schuylkill Trail, which is a beautiful aspect. And then, right outside Philadelphia we have um, a lot of preserved land that are within 20 miles that are still in the Philadelphia area. Philadelphia is a great place to learn, uh, about, um, the environment and environmental change. Uh, we have a lot of resources around here just in the sheer number of universities, uh, around, um, the Philadelphia area. There's a lot of, um, innovative, uh, policies and work going on here in Philadelphia, especially related to the water industry in Philadelphia is very interesting to learn about. Um, pretty much anything that you can think about with, uh, environmental issues, you can focus on here in Philadelphia. Um, anything from, uh, environmental education - there's a lot of work in the schools out here - to looking at wetlands. Um, there's plenty of wetlands around the Philadelphia area that are pretty close to get to and you can get out and get some field work. So, the, um, University of Pennsylvania's just in a terrific location to work with a lot of great partners in the area. Right here in Philadelphia, we have the urban fields station, which is a US Forest Service branch, uh, right here in the city. We also have, um, the Region 3 office of the EPA right downtown and many of our students have gone and worked and done projects with those folks. Um, we have the Tookany/Tacony-Frankford Partnership, which is another community group that works with the Water Department to, um, work on watershed management right here in the city. We have the Stroud Water Research Center not too far away that students have worked with continuously on research projects. Um, we still have, uh, students working with the Academy of Natural Sciences and um, there's just so many opportunities here in the city where students can get involved with groups or organizations."
Environmental Studies at Austin College,9Fwyr8ddjaM,environmental studies,"So my name is Peter Schulze and my field is Ecology, or the study of ecosystems primarily,  and I've been at Austin College since the late 1990's.  Faculty from all over the college are involved in  the Environmental Studies program and  students who major or minor in Environmental Studies take courses from a wide range of faculty--  Some who are environmental specialists  and others who teach very closely related courses like Environmental Economics or Environmental Ethics.  Some do a lot of Field Biology,  some do more Political Science-type things,  and we even have people who combine Environmental Studies with  Art and all kinds of other fields.  I think one of the things that gets students most excited  right off the bat is our courses are not solely about science.  They definitely have heavy science content,  but our program is Environmental Studies. And so the courses also involve social science issues like Economics and issues from all across the campus,  such as ethics questions that are taught by Philosophers.   Once they get into upper-level courses,  then there's all kinds of opportunity to actually,  not just study the subject, but  do something.  So, for example,  students who take a course called Environmental Solutions propose ways to reduce the college's environmental impact.   And over the years, the college has adopted  more than 30 of these proposals that started  as students' projects. I think the hallmarks of the program are getting students actually involved  and actually doing something.  We've created opportunities that students have taken  to get their feet wet... but not always literally.  So sometimes it's in Field Biology,  but other times its finding ways to reduce  the green house gas emissions of the college. Or it may be through a summer internship.  We have exclusive arrangements with  three world-class organizations that work on different subjects  that have internships that are only available to Austin College students.  The Sneed Prairie Project is one of my favorite things  about our program.  It may sound strange to set fires for the sake of an ecosystem, but Austin College is in what's called a  Tall Grass Prairie Biome. The Prairie Biome was maintained by  two natural processes: Herds of bison trampling plants  and fires that burned plants.  The biome has almost completely been eliminated by urban development and agriculture, and so we're trying to restore a little bit of it.  And the fires actually happen to be one of the most powerful tools available. Our students tend to go into any of four areas once they graduate.  Some go to graduate school right away,  but others go to work right away.  And one of the surprises about Environmental Studies is  they're not out there wondering if they're ever going to find a job.  Our students don't tend to be struggling to find jobs. Some of them go to work for  companies as Environmental Specialists. Others work for non-profit organizations,  maybe in advocacy  or in some sort of Environmental Justice work, for example.  And others work for the government, whether it's  a federal government or a state government  or a city government.  You should consider studying the environment at Austin College  because we'll give you the opportunities to  start making a difference while you're here,  and the skills and abilities and experience that you need  to go make an even bigger difference after you graduate."
